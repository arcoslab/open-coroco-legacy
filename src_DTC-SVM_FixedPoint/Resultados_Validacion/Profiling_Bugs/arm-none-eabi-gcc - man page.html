<div class="section" id="Description"><a id="yui_3_17_2_1_1427238259429_211" href="#Description"><h2>Description</h2></a>
<p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1427238259429_219">
When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The “overall options” allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a></span> option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.</p>

<p>Other options are passed on to one stage of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.</p>

<p>Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually C++;), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.</p>

<p>The <code>gcc</code> program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may <em>not</em> be grouped: <span class="option">-dv</span> is very different from <span class="option">-d&nbsp;<a class="in-doc" href="#-v">-v</a></span>.</p>

<p>You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify <span class="option">-L</span> more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-l">-l</a></span> option is significant.</p>

<p>Many options have long names starting with <span class="option">-f</span> or with
<span class="option">-W</span>---for example,
<span class="option">-fmove-loop-invariants</span>, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wformat">-Wformat</a></span> and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
<span class="option">-ffoo</span> is <span class="option">-fno-foo</span>.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.</p>

<p>
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  GCC is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.</p>

<p>For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:</p>
<dl><dt id="file"><a id=".c"></a><em>file</em><span class="markup">.c</span></dt><dd>

C source code that must be preprocessed.
  </dd><dt><a id=".i"></a><em>file</em><span class="markup">.i</span></dt><dd>

  </dd><dt><a id=".ii"></a><em>file</em><span class="markup">.ii</span></dt><dd>

C++; source code that should not be preprocessed.
  </dd><dt><a id=".m"></a><em>file</em><span class="markup">.m</span></dt><dd>

  </dd><dt id="other"><em>other</em></dt><dd>

An object file to be fed straight into linking.
Any file name with no recognized suffix is treated this way.

<p>You can specify the input language explicitly with the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a></span> option:</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-x" class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a> <em><code>language</code></em></dt><dd>

Specify explicitly the <em>language</em> for the following input files
(rather than letting the compiler choose a default based on the file
name suffix).  This option applies to all following input files until
the next <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a></span> option.  Possible values for <em>language</em> are:

<pre><code>c  c-header  cpp-output
c++  c++-header  c++-cpp-output
objective-c  objective-c-header  objective-c-cpp-output
objective-c++ objective-c++-header objective-c++-cpp-output
assembler  assembler-with-cpp
ada
f77  f77-cpp-input f95  f95-cpp-input
go
java</code></pre> 
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a> none</dt><dd>

Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a></span>
has not been used at all).
  </dd><dt><a id="-pass-exit-codes" class="in-doc" href="#-pass-exit-codes">-pass-exit-codes</a></dt><dd>

Normally the <code>gcc</code> program exits with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
<span class="option">-pass-exit-codes</span>, the <code>gcc</code> program instead returns with
the numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
indication.  The C, C++;, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an internal
compiler error is encountered.

<p>If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a></span> (or filename suffixes) to tell <code>gcc</code> where to start, and
one of the options <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a></span>, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-S">-S</a></span>, or <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span> to say where
<code>gcc</code> is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a> cpp-output <a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span>) instruct <code>gcc</code> to do nothing at all.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-c" class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a></dt><dd>

Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.

<p>By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix <span class="markup">.c</span>, <span class="markup">.i</span>, <span class="markup">.s</span>, etc., with <span class="markup">.o</span>.</p>

<p>Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-S" class="in-doc" href="#-S">-S</a></dt><dd>

Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.

<p>By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix <span class="markup">.c</span>, <span class="markup">.i</span>, etc., with <span class="markup">.s</span>.</p>

<p>Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-E" class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></dt><dd>

Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.

<p>Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-o" class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> <em><code>file</code></em></dt><dd>

Place output in file <code class="filename">file</code>.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.

<p>If <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a></span> is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in <em>a.out</em>, the object file for
<em>source.suffix</em> in <em>source.o</em>, its
assembler file in <em>source.s</em>, a precompiled header file in
<em>source.suffix.gch</em>, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-v" class="in-doc" href="#-v">-v</a></dt><dd>

Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
  </dd><dt>-###</dt><dd>

Like <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-v">-v</a></span> except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or <em>`./-_'</em>.
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.
  </dd><dt><a id="-pipe" class="in-doc" href="#-pipe">-pipe</a></dt><dd>

Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the GNU assembler has
no trouble.
  </dd><dt><a id="--help" class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a></dt><dd>

Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by <code>gcc</code>.  If the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-v">-v</a></span> option is also specified
then <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a></span> is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by <code>gcc</code>, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the <span class="option">-Wextra</span> option has also been specified
(prior to the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a></span> option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them are also displayed.
  </dd><dt><a id="--target-help" class="in-doc" href="#--target-help">--target-help</a></dt><dd>

Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line
options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>={<em><code>class</code></em>|[<em>^</em>]<em>qualifier</em><em>}</em>[<em>,...</em>]</dt><dd>

Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:
    <dl><dt><em>optimizers</em></dt><dd>

Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.
      </dd><dt><em>warnings</em></dt><dd>

Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.
      </dd><dt><em>target</em></dt><dd>

Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--target-help">--target-help</a></span> option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=</span> syntax.
      </dd><dt><em>params</em></dt><dd>

Display the values recognized by the <span class="option">--param</span>
option.
      </dd><dt><em>language</em></dt><dd>

Display the options supported for <em>language</em>, where
<em>language</em> is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of GCC.
      </dd><dt><em>common</em></dt><dd>

Display the options that are common to all languages.
      </dd></dl>
  

<p>These are the supported qualifiers:</p>
    <dl><dt><em>undocumented</em></dt><dd>

Display only those options that are undocumented.
      </dd><dt><em>joined</em></dt><dd>

Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=target</span>.
      </dd><dt><em>separate</em></dt><dd>

Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> output-file</span>.
      </dd></dl>
     
  

<p>Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use:</p>

<pre><code><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=target,undocumented</code></pre> 

<p>The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
<em>^</em> character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:</p>

<pre><code><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=warnings,^joined,^undocumented</code></pre> 

<p>The argument to <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=</span> should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.</p>

<p>Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
<em>target</em>.  For example, to display all the target-specific
optimization options, use:</p>

<pre><code><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=target,optimizers</code></pre> 

<p>The <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=</span> option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.</p>

<p>If the <span class="option">-Q</span> option appears on the command line before the
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=</span> option, then the descriptive text displayed by
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=</span> is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=</span> option is used).</p>

<p>Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of <code>gcc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>% gcc -Q -mabi=2 <a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=target <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a>
The following options are target specific:
-mabi=                                2
-mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
-mapcs                                [disabled]</code></pre> 

<p>The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at <span class="option">-O2</span> by using:</p>

<pre><code>-Q -O2 <a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=optimizers</code></pre> 

<p>Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by <span class="option">-O3</span> by using:</p>

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -Q -O3 <a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts
gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -Q -O2 <a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts
diff /tmp/O2-opts /tmp/O3-opts | grep enabled</code></pre> 
     
  </dd><dt><a id="-no-canonical-prefixes" class="in-doc" href="#-no-canonical-prefixes">-no-canonical-prefixes</a></dt><dd>

Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to <code class="filename">/../</code>
or <code class="filename">/./</code>, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.
  </dd><dt><a id="--version" class="in-doc" href="#--version">--version</a></dt><dd>

Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked GCC.
  </dd><dt><a id="-wrapper" class="in-doc" href="#-wrapper">-wrapper</a></dt><dd>

Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of the
wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma separated
list.

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> t.c -wrapper gdb,--args</code></pre> 

<p>This invokes all subprograms of <code>gcc</code> under
<code>gdb --args</code>, thus the invocation of <em>cc1</em> is
<code>gdb --args cc1 ...</code>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fplugin" class="in-doc" href="#-fplugin">-fplugin</a>=<em><code>name</code></em><span class="markup">.so</span></dt><dd>

Load the plugin code in file <code class="filename">name</code>.so, assumed to be a
shared object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.  The base name of
the shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the
purposes of argument parsing (See
<span class="option">-fplugin-arg-</span><em><code>name</code></em><em>-</em><em>key</em><em>=</em><em>value</em> below).
Each plugin should define the callback functions specified in the
Plugins API.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fplugin-arg-" class="in-doc" href="#-fplugin-arg-">-fplugin-arg-</a><em><code>name</code></em><em>-</em><em>key</em><em>=</em><em>value</em></dt><dd>

Define an argument called <em>key</em> with a value of <em>value</em>
for the plugin called <em>name</em>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fdump-ada-spec" class="in-doc" href="#-fdump-ada-spec">-fdump-ada-spec</a>[<a id="-slim" class="in-doc" href="#-slim">-slim</a>]</dt><dd>

For C and C++; source and include files, generate corresponding Ada specs.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fada-spec-parent" class="in-doc" href="#-fada-spec-parent">-fada-spec-parent</a>=<em><code>unit</code></em></dt><dd>

In conjunction with <span class="option">-fdump-ada-spec</span>[<span class="option">-slim</span>] above, generate
Ada specs as child units of parent <em>unit</em>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fdump-go-spec" class="in-doc" href="#-fdump-go-spec">-fdump-go-spec</a>=<em><code>file</code></em></dt><dd>

For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
declarations in <em>file</em>.  This generates Go <em>`const'</em>,
<em>`type'</em>, <em>`var'</em>, and <em>`func'</em> declarations which may be a
useful way to start writing a Go interface to code written in some
other language.
  </dd><dt><em>@</em><em>file</em></dt><dd>

Read command-line options from <em>file</em>.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @<em>file</em> option.  If <em>file</em>
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.

<p>Options in <em>file</em> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The <em>file</em> may itself contain additional
@<em>file</em> options; any such options will be processed recursively.</p>

<div class="subsection" id="Options-Compiling_C++;_Programs"><a href="#Options-Compiling_C++;_Programs"><h3>Compiling C++; Programs</h3></a>
<p>
C++; source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <span class="markup">.C</span>,
<span class="markup">.cc</span>, <span class="markup">.cpp</span>, <span class="markup">.CPP</span>, <span class="markup">.c++</span>, <span class="markup">.cp</span>, or
<span class="markup">.cxx</span>; C++; header files often use <span class="markup">.hh</span>, <span class="markup">.hpp</span>,
<span class="markup">.H</span>, or (for shared template code) <span class="markup">.tcc</span>; and
preprocessed C++; files use the suffix <span class="markup">.ii</span>.  GCC recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as C++; programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name <code>gcc</code>).</p>

<p>However, the use of <code>gcc</code> does not add the C++; library.
<em>g++</em> is a program that calls GCC and automatically specifies linking
against the C++; library.  It treats <span class="markup">.c</span>,
<span class="markup">.h</span> and <span class="markup">.i</span> files as C++; source files instead of C source
files unless <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a></span> is used.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a <span class="markup">.h</span> extension for use in C++;
compilations.  On many systems, <em>g++</em> is also installed with
the name <em>c++</em>.</p>

<p>When you compile C++; programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for C++; programs.</p>
</div>

<div class="subsection" id="Options-Options_Controlling_C_Dialect"><a href="#Options-Options_Controlling_C_Dialect"><h3>Options Controlling C Dialect</h3></a>
<p>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as C++;, Objective-C and Objective-C++;) that the compiler
accepts:</p>
<dl><dt><a id="-ansi" class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></dt><dd>

In C mode, this is equivalent to <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a>=c90</span>. In C++; mode, it is
equivalent to <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a>=c++98</span>.

<p>This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO
C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++; (when compiling C++; code),
such as the <em>`asm'</em> and <em>`typeof'</em> keywords, and
predefined macros such as <em>`unix'</em> and <em>`vax'</em> that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used ISO trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of C++; style <code class="filename">//</code> comments as well as
the <em>`inline'</em> keyword.</p>

<p>The alternate keywords <em>`_ _asm_ _'</em>, <em>`_ _extension_ _'</em>,
<em>`_ _inline_ _'</em> and <em>`_ _typeof_ _'</em> continue to work despite
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span>.  You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span>.  Alternate predefined macros
such as <em>`_ _unix_ _'</em> and <em>`_ _vax_ _'</em> are also available, with or
without <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, <span class="option">-Wpedantic</span> is required in
addition to <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span>.</p>

<p>The macro <em>`_ _STRICT_ANSI_ _'</em> is predefined when the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span>
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
ISO standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.</p>

<p>Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by ISO C (such as <em>`alloca'</em> and <em>`ffs'</em>) are not built-in
functions when <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span> is used.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-std" class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a>=</dt><dd>

Determine the language standard.   This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or C++;.

<p>The compiler can accept several base standards, such as <em>c90</em> or
<em>c++98</em>, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as
<em>gnu90</em> or <em>gnu++98</em>.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using GNU extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a>=c90</span> turns off certain features of GCC that are
incompatible with ISO C90, such as the <em>`asm'</em> and <em>`typeof'</em>
keywords, but not other GNU extensions that do not have a meaning in
ISO C90, such as omitting the middle term of a <em>`?:'</em>
expression. On the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by <span class="option">-Wpedantic</span> to identify which features are GNU
extensions given that version of the standard. For example

The option <span class="option">-fgnu89-inline</span> tells GCC to use the traditional
GNU semantics for <em>`inline'</em> functions when in C99 mode.
  This option
is accepted and ignored by GCC versions 4.1.3 up to but not including
4.3.  In GCC versions 4.3 and later it changes the behavior of GCC in
C99 mode.  Using this option is roughly equivalent to adding the
<em>`gnu_inline'</em> function attribute to all inline functions.

<p>The option <span class="option">-fno-gnu89-inline</span> explicitly tells GCC to use the
C99 semantics for <em>`inline'</em> when in C99 or gnu99 mode (i.e., it
specifies the default behavior).  This option was first supported in
GCC 4.3.  This option is not supported in <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a>=c90</span> or
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a>=gnu90</span> mode.</p>

  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-asm" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-asm">-fno-asm</a></dt><dd>

Do not recognize <em>`asm'</em>, <em>`inline'</em> or <em>`typeof'</em> as a
keyword, so that code can use these words as identifiers.  You can use
the keywords <em>`_ _asm_ _'</em>, <em>`_ _inline_ _'</em> and <em>`_ _typeof_ _'</em>
instead.  <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span> implies <span class="option">-fno-asm</span>.

<p>In C++;, this switch only affects the <em>`typeof'</em> keyword, since
<em>`asm'</em> and <em>`inline'</em> are standard keywords.  You may want to
use the <span class="option">-fno-gnu-keywords</span> flag instead, which has the same
effect.  In C99 mode (<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a>=c99</span> or <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a>=gnu99</span>), this
switch only affects the <em>`asm'</em> and <em>`typeof'</em> keywords, since

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
<em>_ _builtin_</em> as prefix.

<p>GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to <em>`alloca'</em> may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to <em>`memcpy'</em>
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, GCC may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wformat">-Wformat</a></span> for bad calls to
<em>`printf'</em> when <em>`printf'</em> is built in and <em>`strlen'</em> is
known not to modify global memory.</p>

<p>With the <span class="option">-fno-builtin-</span><em><code>function</code></em> option
only the built-in function <em>function</em> is
disabled.  <em>function</em> must not begin with <em>_ _builtin_</em>.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of GCC, this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
<span class="option">-fbuiltin-</span><em><code>function</code></em> option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using <span class="option">-fno-builtin</span> or
<span class="option">-ffreestanding</span>, you may define macros such as:</p>

<pre><code>#define abs(n)          __builtin_abs ((n))
#define strcpy(d, s)    __builtin_strcpy ((d), (s))</code></pre>

Assert that compilation targets a hosted environment.  This implies
<span class="option">-fbuiltin</span>.  A hosted environment is one in which the
entire standard library is available, and in which <em>`main'</em> has a return
type of <em>`int'</em>.  Examples are nearly everything except a kernel.
This is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-freestanding</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-ffreestanding" class="in-doc" href="#-ffreestanding">-ffreestanding</a></dt><dd>

Assert that compilation targets a freestanding environment.  This
implies <span class="option">-fno-builtin</span>.  A freestanding environment
is one in which the standard library may not exist, and program startup may
not necessarily be at <em>`main'</em>.  The most obvious example is an OS kernel.
This is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-hosted</span>.

Enable handling of OpenMP directives <em>`#pragma omp'</em> in C/C++; and

compiler generates parallel code according to the OpenMP Application
Program Interface v3.0 &lt;<em><a href="http://www.openmp.org/">www.openmp.org/</a></em>&gt;.  This option

  </dd><dt><a id="-fgnu-tm" class="in-doc" href="#-fgnu-tm">-fgnu-tm</a></dt><dd>

When the option <span class="option">-fgnu-tm</span> is specified, the compiler

Let the type <em>`char'</em> be unsigned, like <em>`unsigned char'</em>.

<p>Each kind of machine has a default for what <em>`char'</em> should
be.  It is either like <em>`unsigned char'</em> by default or like
<em>`signed char'</em> by default.</p>

<p>Ideally, a portable program should always use <em>`signed char'</em> or
<em>`unsigned char'</em> when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain <em>`char'</em> and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.</p>

<p>The type <em>`char'</em> is always a distinct type from each of
<em>`signed char'</em> or <em>`unsigned char'</em>, even though its behavior
is always just like one of those two.</p>

<p>
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for C++; programs.  You can also use most of the GNU compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file <em>`firstClass.C'</em> like this:</p>

<pre><code>g++ <a class="in-doc" href="#-g">-g</a> -frepo -O <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> firstClass.C</code></pre> 

<p>In this example, only <span class="option">-frepo</span> is an option meant
only for C++; programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by GCC.</p>

<p>Here is a list of options that are <em>only</em> for compiling C++; programs:</p>
<dl><dt><a id="-fabi-version" class="in-doc" href="#-fabi-version">-fabi-version</a>=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>

Use version <em>n</em> of the C++; ABI.  The default is version 2.

<p>Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the C++; ABI specification.  Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.</p>

<p>Version 1 is the version of the C++; ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.2.</p>

<p>Version 2 is the version of the C++; ABI that first appeared in G++ 3.4.</p>

<p>Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.</p>

<p>Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.</p>

<p>Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.</p>

<p>Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of C++;11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and --, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.</p>

<p>See also <span class="option">-Wabi</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-access-control" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-access-control">-fno-access-control</a></dt><dd>

around bugs in the access control code.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fcheck-new" class="in-doc" href="#-fcheck-new">-fcheck-new</a></dt><dd>

Check that the pointer returned by <em>`operator new'</em> is non-null
before attempting to modify the storage allocated.  This check is
normally unnecessary because the C++; standard specifies that
<em>`operator new'</em> only returns <em>0</em> if it is declared
<em>throw()</em>, in which case the compiler always checks the
return value even without this option.  In all other cases, when
<em>`operator new'</em> has a non-empty exception specification, memory
exhaustion is signalled by throwing <em>`std::bad_alloc'</em>.  See also
<em>new (nothrow)</em>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fconstexpr-depth" class="in-doc" href="#-fconstexpr-depth">-fconstexpr-depth</a>=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the maximum nested evaluation depth for C++;11 constexpr functions
to <em>n</em>.  A limit is needed to detect endless recursion during
constant expression evaluation.  The minimum specified by the standard
is 512.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fdeduce-init-list" class="in-doc" href="#-fdeduce-init-list">-fdeduce-init-list</a></dt><dd>

Enable deduction of a template type parameter as
<em>`std::initializer_list'</em> from a brace-enclosed initializer list, i.e.

<pre><code>template &lt;class T&gt; auto forward(T t) -&gt; decltype (realfn (t))
{
  return realfn (t);
}

void f()
{
  forward({1,2}); // call forward&lt;std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt;&gt;
}</code></pre> 

<p>This deduction was implemented as a possible extension to the
originally proposed semantics for the C++;11 standard, but was not part
of the final standard, so it is disabled by default.  This option is
deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-ffriend-injection" class="in-doc" href="#-ffriend-injection">-ffriend-injection</a></dt><dd>

Inject friend functions into the enclosing namespace, so that they are
visible outside the scope of the class in which they are declared.
Friend functions were documented to work this way in the old Annotated
C++; Reference Manual, and versions of G++ before 4.1 always worked
that way.  However, in ISO C++; a friend function that is not declared
in an enclosing scope can only be found using argument dependent
lookup.  This option causes friends to be injected as they were in
earlier releases.

<p>This option is for compatibility, and may be removed in a future
release of G++.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-elide-constructors" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-elide-constructors">-fno-elide-constructors</a></dt><dd>

The C++; standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary
that is only used to initialize another object of the same type.
Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-enforce-eh-specs" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-enforce-eh-specs">-fno-enforce-eh-specs</a></dt><dd>

Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the C++; standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
<em>NDEBUG</em>.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.

  <dt><a id="-fno-extern-tls-init" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-extern-tls-init">-fno-extern-tls-init</a></dt><dd>


The C++;11 and OpenMP standards allow <em>thread_local</em> and
<em>threadprivate</em> variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization.
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining TU needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining TU will be executed before any uses in
another TU), they can avoid this overhead with the
<span class="option">-fno-extern-tls-init</span> option.

<p>On targets that support symbol aliases, the default is
<span class="option">-fextern-tls-init</span>.  On targets that do not support symbol
aliases, the default is <span class="option">-fno-extern-tls-init</span>.</p>

  <dt><a id="-fno-for-scope" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-for-scope">-fno-for-scope</a></dt><dd>


If <span class="option">-ffor-scope</span> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <em>for-init-statement</em> is limited to the <em>for</em> loop itself,
as specified by the C++; standard.
If <span class="option">-fno-for-scope</span> is specified, the scope of variables declared in
a <em>for-init-statement</em> extends to the end of the enclosing scope,
as was the case in old versions of G++, and other (traditional)
implementations of C++;.

<p>If neither flag is given, the default is to follow the standard,
but to allow and give a warning for old-style code that would
otherwise be invalid, or have different behavior.</p>

  </dd><dt><a id="-fnothrow-opt" class="in-doc" href="#-fnothrow-opt">-fnothrow-opt</a></dt><dd>

Treat a <em>`throw()'</em> exception specification as if it were a
<em>`noexcept'</em> specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the EH cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of

  </dd><dt><a id="-fpermissive" class="in-doc" href="#-fpermissive">-fpermissive</a></dt><dd>

Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to

  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-pretty-templates" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-pretty-templates">-fno-pretty-templates</a></dt><dd>

When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. <em>`void f(T) [with T = int]'</em>
rather than <em>`void f(int)'</em>) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use <span class="option">-fno-pretty-templates</span> to disable them.
  </dd><dt><a id="-frepo" class="in-doc" href="#-frepo">-frepo</a></dt><dd>

Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the C++; run-time type identification features
(<em>dynamic_cast</em> and <em>typeid</em>).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The <em>dynamic_cast</em> operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to <em>`void *'</em> or to
unambiguous base classes.

Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the C++; standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a

Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to <em>n</em>.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  ANSI/ISO C++;
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17

This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.

<p>The effect of this is that GCC may, effectively, mark inline methods with
<em>`_ _attribute_ _ ((visibility ("hidden")))'</em> so that they do not
appear in the export table of a DSO and do not require a PLT indirection
when used within the DSO.  Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a DSO as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.</p>

<p>The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.</p>

<p>You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.</p>

<p>Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fvisibility-ms-compat" class="in-doc" href="#-fvisibility-ms-compat">-fvisibility-ms-compat</a></dt><dd>

This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make GCC's C++;
linkage model compatible with that of Microsoft Visual Studio.

<p>The flag makes these changes to GCC's linkage model:</p>
    <dl class="same-line"><dt>1.</dt><dd>
It sets the default visibility to <em>`hidden'</em>, like
<span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span>.
      </dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>
Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
      </dd><dt>3.</dt><dd>
The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
      </dd></dl>
  

<p>In new code it is better to use <span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span> and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.</p>

<p>Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the ODR to define types with the same name differently.

Do not use weak symbol support, even if it is provided by the linker.

Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the
vendor-neutral C++; ABI.  Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.

<p>You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.</p>

<p>The known incompatibilities in <span class="option">-fabi-version=2</span> (the default) include:</p>
    <ul><li>
<p>A template with a non-type template parameter of reference type is
mangled incorrectly:</p>

<pre><code>extern int N;
template &lt;int &amp;&gt; struct S {};

void n (S&lt;N&gt;) {2}</code></pre> 
<p>This is fixed in <span class="option">-fabi-version=3</span>.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>SIMD vector types declared using <em>`_ _attribute ((vector_size))'</em> are
mangled in a non-standard way that does not allow for overloading of
functions taking vectors of different sizes.</p>

<p>The mangling is changed in <span class="option">-fabi-version=4</span>.</p>
      </li></ul>
  

<p>The known incompatibilities in <span class="option">-fabi-version=1</span> include:</p>
    <ul><li>
<p>Incorrect handling of tail-padding for bit-fields.  G++ may attempt to
pack data into the same byte as a base class.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>struct A { virtual void f(); int f1 : 1; };
struct B : public A { int f2 : 1; };</code></pre> 
<p>In this case, G++ places <em>`B::f2'</em> into the same byte
as <em>`A::f1'</em>; other compilers do not.  You can avoid this problem
by explicitly padding <em>`A'</em> so that its size is a multiple of the
byte size on your platform; that causes G++ and other compilers to
lay out <em>`B'</em> identically.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Incorrect handling of tail-padding for virtual bases.  G++ does not use
tail padding when laying out virtual bases.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>struct A { virtual void f(); char c1; };
struct B { B(); char c2; };
struct C : public A, public virtual B {};</code></pre> 
<p>In this case, G++ does not place <em>`B'</em> into the tail-padding for
<em>`A'</em>; other compilers do.  You can avoid this problem by
explicitly padding <em>`A'</em> so that its size is a multiple of its
alignment (ignoring virtual base classes); that causes G++ and other
compilers to lay out <em>`C'</em> identically.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Incorrect handling of bit-fields with declared widths greater than that
of their underlying types, when the bit-fields appear in a union.  For
example:</p>

<pre><code>union U { int i : 4096; };</code></pre> 

<p>Assuming that an <em>`int'</em> does not have 4096 bits, G++ makes the
union too small by the number of bits in an <em>`int'</em>.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Empty classes can be placed at incorrect offsets.  For example:</p>

<pre><code></code></pre> 
<p>G++ places the <em>`A'</em> base class of <em>`C'</em> at a nonzero offset;
it should be placed at offset zero.  G++ mistakenly believes that the
<em>`A'</em> data member of <em>`B'</em> is already at offset zero.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Names of template functions whose types involve <em>`typename'</em> or
template template parameters can be mangled incorrectly.</p>

<pre><code>        template &lt;typename Q&gt;

        void f(typename Q::X) {}<br><br><br>
        <br>
        template &lt;template &lt;typename&gt; class Q&gt;<br>
<br><br>
        void f(typename Q&lt;int&gt;::X) {}</code></pre> 
<p>Instantiations of these templates may be mangled incorrectly.</p>
      </li></ul>
     
  

<p>It also warns about psABI-related changes.  The known psABI changes at this
point include:</p>
    <ul><li>
<p>For SysV/x86-64, unions with <em>`long double'</em> members are 
passed in memory as specified in psABI.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>union U {
  long double ld;
  int i;
};</code></pre>

For example:

Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared
within a template.  Since the advent of explicit template specification
support in G++, if the name of the friend is an unqualified-id (i.e.,
<em>friend foo(int)</em>), the C++; language specification demands that the
friend declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function.  (Section
14.5.3).  Before G++ implemented explicit specification, unqualified-ids
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a templatized
function.  Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default
behavior for G++, <span class="option">-Wnon-template-friend</span> allows the compiler to

For example, you might compile a file <em>`some_class.m'</em> like this:</p>

<p>Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,

case, Version 0 is the traditional (32-bit) ABI without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32-bit) ABI with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64-bit) ABI.  If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64-bit target machines.

For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
C++; object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special <em>`- (id) .cxx_construct'</em> instance method which runs
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return <em>`self'</em>.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a C++; object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special <em>`- (void) .cxx_destruct'</em> method which runs
all such default destructors, in reverse order.

<p>The <em>`- (id) .cxx_construct'</em> and <em>`- (void) .cxx_destruct'</em>
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The <em>`- (id) .cxx_construct'</em> methods are invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the <em>`- (void) .cxx_destruct'</em> methods are invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.</p>

<p>As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac OS X 10.4 and later has
support for invoking the <em>`- (id) .cxx_construct'</em> and
<em>`- (void) .cxx_destruct'</em> methods.</p>

this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective-C++; compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by GCC 4.0 is rejected.

When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to <em>`objc_getClass("...")'</em> (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the <span class="option">-fzero-link</span> flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to <em>`objc_getClass("...")'</em>
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
The GNU runtime currently always retains calls to <em>`objc_get_class("...")'</em>
regardless of command-line options.

If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for

default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited

methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,

during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final

<div class="subsection" id="Options-Options_to_Control_Diagnostic_Messages_Formatting"><a href="#Options-Options_to_Control_Diagnostic_Messages_Formatting"><h3>Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting</h3></a>
<p>
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  You can use the
options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, 
e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.</p>
<dl><dt><a id="-fmessage-length" class="in-doc" href="#-fmessage-length">-fmessage-length</a>=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>

Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about <em>n</em>
characters.  The default is 72 characters for <em>g++</em> and 0 for the rest of
the front ends supported by GCC.  If <em>n</em> is zero, then no
line-wrapping is done; each error message appears on a single
line.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fdiagnostics-show-location" class="in-doc" href="#-fdiagnostics-show-location">-fdiagnostics-show-location</a>=once</dt><dd>

Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information <em>once</em>; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-fdiagnostics-show-location">-fdiagnostics-show-location</a>=every-line</dt><dd>

Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-diagnostics-show-option" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-diagnostics-show-option">-fno-diagnostics-show-option</a></dt><dd>

By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the
command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an
option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
<span class="option">-fno-diagnostics-show-option</span> flag suppresses that behavior.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-diagnostics-show-caret" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-diagnostics-show-caret">-fno-diagnostics-show-caret</a></dt><dd>

By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original source line
and a caret '^' indicating the column.  This option suppresses this
information.

</div>

<div class="subsection" id="Options-Options_to_Request_or_Suppress_Warnings"><a href="#Options-Options_to_Request_or_Suppress_Warnings"><h3>Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3></a>
<p>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.</p>

<p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.</p>
<dl><dt><a id="-fsyntax-only" class="in-doc" href="#-fsyntax-only">-fsyntax-only</a></dt><dd>

Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fmax-errors" class="in-doc" href="#-fmax-errors">-fmax-errors</a>=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>

Limits the maximum number of error messages to <em>n</em>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <em>n</em> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <span class="option">-Wfatal-errors</span> is also
specified, then <span class="option">-Wfatal-errors</span> takes precedence over this
option.
  </dd><dt><a id="-w" class="in-doc" href="#-w">-w</a></dt><dd>

Inhibit all warning messages.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Werror" class="in-doc" href="#-Werror">-Werror</a></dt><dd>

Make all warnings into errors.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Werror">-Werror</a>=</dt><dd>

Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Werror">-Werror</a>=switch</span> turns the warnings
controlled by <span class="option">-Wswitch</span> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Werror">-Werror</a></span> for specific
warnings; for example <span class="option">-Wno-error=switch</span> makes
<span class="option">-Wswitch</span> warnings not be errors, even when <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Werror">-Werror</a></span>
is in effect.

<p>The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Werror">-Werror</a>=</span> and <span class="option">-Wno-error=</span> as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<span class="option">-fno-diagnostics-show-option</span> flag.)</p>

<p>Note that specifying <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Werror">-Werror</a>=</span><em><code>foo</code></em> automatically implies
<span class="option">-W</span><em><code>foo</code></em>.  However, <span class="option">-Wno-error=</span><em><code>foo</code></em> does not
imply anything.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wfatal-errors" class="in-doc" href="#-Wfatal-errors">-Wfatal-errors</a></dt><dd>

This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
<span class="option">-W</span>, for example <span class="option">-Wimplicit</span> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning <span class="option">-Wno-</span> to turn off warnings; for
example, <span class="option">-Wno-implicit</span>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <em>C++; Dialect Options</em> and
<em>Objective-C and Objective-C++; Dialect Options</em>.</p>

<p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<span class="option">-Wunknown-warning</span>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <span class="option">-Wno-</span> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <span class="option">-Wno-unknown-warning</span> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <span class="option">-Wno-</span> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.</p>

Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++;.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a></span> option used.

<p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++; programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-ansi">-ansi</a></span> or a
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a></span> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++;
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.</p>

<p><span class="option">-Wpedantic</span> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <em>_ _</em>.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<em>`_ _extension_ _'</em>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.</p>

<p>Some users try to use <span class="option">-Wpedantic</span> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all---only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.</p>

<p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <span class="option">-Wpedantic</span>.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.</p>

<p>Where the standard specified with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-std">-std</a></span> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as <em>gnu90</em> or <em>gnu99</em>, there is a
corresponding <em>base standard</em>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <span class="option">-Wpedantic</span> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)</p>

Warn if the return type of a function has a type qualifier
such as <em>`const'</em>.  For ISO C such a type qualifier has no effect,
since the value returned by a function is not an lvalue.
For C++;, the warning is only emitted for scalar types or <em>`void'</em>.
ISO C prohibits qualified <em>`void'</em> return types on function
definitions, so such return types always receive a warning

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wparentheses" class="in-doc" href="#-Wparentheses">-Wparentheses</a></dt><dd>

Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.

<p>Also warn if a comparison like <em>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</em> appears; this is
equivalent to <em>(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</em>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.</p>

<p>Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
<em>`if'</em> statement an <em>`else'</em> branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:</p>

<pre><code>        {

<span class="func-name">if</span>(if ( b ) <var>foo</var>( ));<br><br>else <span class="func-name">bar</span>();<br><br>
        }<br></code></pre> 
<p>In C/C++;, every <em>`else'</em> branch belongs to the innermost possible
<em>`if'</em> statement, which in this example is <em>`if (b)'</em>.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost <em>`if'</em> statement so there is no way the <em>`else'</em>
can belong to the enclosing <em>`if'</em>.  The resulting code
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>        {

<span class="func-name">if</span>({ if ( b ) <var>foo</var>( ));<br><br>else <span class="func-name">bar</span>();<br><br>
            }<br>
        }</code></pre> 
<p>Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to
<em>`?:'</em> with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the <em>`?'</em>: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.</p>

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wsequence-point" class="in-doc" href="#-Wsequence-point">-Wsequence-point</a></dt><dd>

Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and C++; standards.

<p>The C and C++; standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++;
program are evaluated in terms of <em>sequence points</em>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<em>`&amp;&amp;'</em>, <strong>`||'</strong>, <em>`? :'</em> or <em>`,'</em> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.</p>

<p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++; standards specify that “Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.”.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.</p>

<p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <em>`a = a++;'</em>, <em>`a[n]
= b[n++]'</em> and <em>`a[i++] = i;'</em>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.</p>

<p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at
&lt;<em><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html">gcc.gnu.org/readings.html</a></em>&gt;.</p>

Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that defaults

without a value), and about a <em>`return'</em> statement with an
expression in a function whose return type is <em>`void'</em>.

<p>For C++;, a function without return type always produces a diagnostic
message, even when <span class="option">-Wno-return-type</span> is specified.  The only

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wuninitialized" class="in-doc" href="#-Wuninitialized">-Wuninitialized</a></dt><dd>

Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a <em>`setjmp'</em> call. In C++;,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static <em>const</em> member
appears in a class without constructors.

<p>If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the <span class="option">-Winit-self</span> option.</p>

<p>These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared <em>`volatile'</em>.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of GCC used.</p>

<p>Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wmaybe-uninitialized" class="in-doc" href="#-Wmaybe-uninitialized">-Wmaybe-uninitialized</a></dt><dd>

For an automatic variable, if there exists a path from the function
entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time. These warnings are made optional because GCC is
not smart enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
this can happen:

<pre><code>        {

          int x;

<span class="func-name">switch</span>({ case 1: <var>x</var>= 1);<br><br><br>
              break;<br>
            case 2: x = 4;<br>
              break;<br>
            case 3: x = 5;<br>
<br>
            }<br><br><span class="func-name">foo</span>(<var>x</var>);<br><br><br>
        }<br></code></pre> 
<p>If the value of <em>`y'</em> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <em>`x'</em> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with assert(0) or
similar code.</p>

<p>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <em>`longjmp'</em>.  These warnings as well are possible
only in optimizing compilation.</p>

<p>The compiler sees only the calls to <em>`setjmp'</em>.  It cannot know
where <em>`longjmp'</em> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <em>`longjmp'</em> cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.</p>

<p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <em>`noreturn'</em>.</p>

This option is only active when <span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span> is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the

Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way <span class="option">-O</span> 
works.
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-aliasing">-Wstrict-aliasing</a></span> is equivalent to <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-aliasing">-Wstrict-aliasing</a>=3</span>.

<p>Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but <span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span> still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.</p>

<p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.</p>

<p>Level 3 (default for <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-aliasing">-Wstrict-aliasing</a></span>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:

  <dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a>=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>


This option is only active when <span class="option">-fstrict-overflow</span> is active.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.

<p>An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.</p>
    <dl><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a>=1</dt><dd>

Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For
example,  with <span class="option">-fstrict-overflow</span>, the compiler simplifies
<em>`x + 1 &gt; x'</em> to <em>1</em>.  This level of
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a></span> is enabled by <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wall">-Wall</a></span>; higher levels
are not, and must be explicitly requested.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a>=2</dt><dd>

Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: <em>`abs (x) &gt;= 0'</em>.  This can only be
simplified when <span class="option">-fstrict-overflow</span> is in effect, because
<em>`abs (INT_MIN)'</em> overflows to <em>`INT_MIN'</em>, which is less than
zero.  <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a></span> (with no level) is the same as
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a>=2</span>.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a>=3</dt><dd>

Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For

      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a>=4</dt><dd>

Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.

      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wstrict-overflow">-Wstrict-overflow</a>=5</dt><dd>

Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: <em>`x + 2 &gt; y'</em> is
simplified to <em>`x + 1 &gt;= y'</em>.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

Warn for cases where adding an attribute may be beneficial. The

    <dl><dt>-Wsuggest-attribute=pure</dt>


      <dt>-Wsuggest-attribute=const</dt>

      <dt>-Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn</dt><dd>


Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes
<em>`pure'</em>, <em>`const'</em> or <em>`noreturn'</em>.  The compiler only warns for
functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case of <em>`pure'</em> and
<em>`const'</em>) if it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A function
returns normally if it doesn't contain an infinite loop or return abnormally
by throwing, calling <em>`abort()'</em> or trapping.  This analysis requires option
<span class="option">-fipa-pure-const</span>, which is enabled by default at <span class="option">-O</span> and
higher.  Higher optimization levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.
      </dd><dt>-Wsuggest-attribute=format</dt>


      <dt>-Wmissing-format-attribute</dt><dd>


Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for <em>`format'</em>
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
GCC guesses that function pointers with <em>`format'</em> attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
statements should have a corresponding <em>`format'</em> attribute in the
resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
of the containing function respectively should also have a <em>`format'</em>
attribute to avoid the warning.

<p>GCC also warns about function definitions that might be
candidates for <em>`format'</em> attributes.  Again, these are only
possible candidates.  GCC guesses that <em>`format'</em> attributes
might be appropriate for any function that calls a function like
<em>`vprintf'</em> or <em>`vscanf'</em>, but this might not always be the
case, and some functions for which <em>`format'</em> attributes are
appropriate may not be detected.</p>

Warnings from system headers are normally suppressed, on the assumption
that they usually do not indicate real problems and would only make the
compiler output harder to read.  Using this command-line option tells
GCC to emit warnings from system headers as if they occurred in user

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wtrampolines" class="in-doc" href="#-Wtrampolines">-Wtrampolines</a></dt><dd>

<pre><code>Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.

A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and
is used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it
is made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But,
for most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack
to be made executable in order for the program to work properly.</code></pre>

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wfloat-equal" class="in-doc" href="#-Wfloat-equal">-Wfloat-equal</a></dt><dd>

Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.

<p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wtraditional" class="in-doc" href="#-Wtraditional">-Wtraditional</a> (C and Objective-C only)</dt><dd>

Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
    <ul><li>
<p>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in ISO C it does not.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the <em>#</em> appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wtraditional">-Wtraditional</a></span> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the <em>#</em> does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<em>#pragma</em> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <em>#elif</em>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>The unary plus operator.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>The <em>U</em> integer constant suffix, or the <em>F</em> or <em>L</em> floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the <em>L</em> suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the <em>_MIN</em>/<em>_MAX</em> macros in <em>`&lt;limits.h&gt;'</em>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>A <em>`switch'</em> statement has an operand of type <em>`long'</em>.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>A non-<em>`static'</em> function declaration follows a <em>`static'</em> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Initialization of automatic aggregates.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <em>`_ _STDC_ _'</em> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <span class="option">-Wtraditional-conversion</span>.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, <em>`PARAMS'</em> and
<em>`VPARAMS'</em>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.</p>

Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier from

to an ordinary <em>`char *'</em>.

<p>Also warn when making a cast that introduces a type qualifier in an
unsafe way.  For example, casting <em>`char **'</em> to <em>`const char **'</em>

const char **q = (const char **) p;
/* Assignment of readonly string to const char * is OK.  */

*q = "string";
/* Now char** pointer points to read-only memory.  */

**p = b;</code></pre>

types.)
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wold-style-declaration" class="in-doc" href="#-Wold-style-declaration">-Wold-style-declaration</a> (C and Objective-C only)</dt><dd>

Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wmissing-parameter-type" class="in-doc" href="#-Wmissing-parameter-type">-Wmissing-parameter-type</a> (C and Objective-C only)</dt><dd>

A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&amp;R-style

<pre><code>void foo(bar) { }</code></pre> 
<p>This warning is also enabled by <span class="option">-Wextra</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wmissing-prototypes" class="in-doc" href="#-Wmissing-prototypes">-Wmissing-prototypes</a> (C and Objective-C only)</dt><dd>

Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions
that do not have a matching prototype declaration in a header file.
This option is not valid for C++; because all function declarations
provide prototypes and a non-matching declaration will declare an
overload rather than conflict with an earlier declaration.
Use <span class="option">-Wmissing-declarations</span> to detect missing declarations in C++;.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wmissing-declarations" class="in-doc" href="#-Wmissing-declarations">-Wmissing-declarations</a></dt><dd>

Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for functions with previous
non-prototype declarations; use <span class="option">-Wmissing-prototype</span> to detect
missing prototypes.  In C++;, no warnings are issued for function templates,
or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wmissing-field-initializers" class="in-doc" href="#-Wmissing-field-initializers">-Wmissing-field-initializers</a></dt><dd>

Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code causes such a warning, because
<em>`x.h'</em> is implicitly zero:

<pre><code>struct s { int f, g, h; };
struct s x = { 3, 4 };</code></pre> 

<p>This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification does not trigger a warning:</p>

<pre><code>struct s { int f, g, h; };
struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };</code></pre> 

<p>This warning is included in <span class="option">-Wextra</span>.  To get other <span class="option">-Wextra</span>
warnings without this one, use <span class="option">-Wextra -Wno-missing-field-initializers</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wno-multichar" class="in-doc" href="#-Wno-multichar">-Wno-multichar</a></dt><dd>

Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (<em>'FOOF'</em>) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wnormalized" class="in-doc" href="#-Wnormalized">-Wnormalized</a>=&lt;none|id|nfc|nfkc&gt;</dt><dd>

In ISO C and ISO C++;, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <em>normalization rules</em> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.

<p>There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfc</span>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 “C” normalized form, <em>NFC</em>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++; that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++; and have all your identifiers in NFC.
<span class="option">-Wnormalized=id</span> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.</p>

<p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<span class="option">-Wnormalized=none</span>.  You should only do this if you
are using some other normalization scheme (like “D”), because
otherwise you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.</p>

<p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <em>`\u207F'</em>, “SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N”, displays just like a regular <em>`n'</em> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <em>NFKC</em>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<span class="option">-Wnormalized=nfkc</span>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.</p>

<p>This warning is included in <span class="option">-Wextra</span>.  To get other
<span class="option">-Wextra</span> warnings without this one, use <span class="option">-Wextra
-Wno-override-init</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wpacked" class="in-doc" href="#-Wpacked">-Wpacked</a></dt><dd>

Warn if a structure is given the packed attribute, but the packed
attribute has no effect on the layout or size of the structure.
Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable <em>`f.x'</em> in <em>`struct bar'</em>
is misaligned even though <em>`struct bar'</em> does not itself
have the packed attribute:

<pre><code></code></pre> 
<p>
The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of GCC ignore the <em>`packed'</em> attribute
on bit-fields of type <em>`char'</em>.  This has been fixed in GCC 4.4 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  GCC
informs you when the offset of such a field has changed in GCC 4.4.
For example there is no longer a 4-bit padding between field <em>`a'</em>
and <em>`b'</em> in this structure:</p>

<pre><code>struct foo
{

  char a:4;
  char b:8;

} _ _attribute_ _ ((packed));</code></pre> 
<p>This warning is enabled by default.  Use
<span class="option">-Wno-packed-bitfield-compat</span> to disable this warning.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wpadded" class="in-doc" href="#-Wpadded">-Wpadded</a></dt><dd>

Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wredundant-decls" class="in-doc" href="#-Wredundant-decls">-Wredundant-decls</a></dt><dd>

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor" class="in-doc" href="#-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor">-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor</a></dt><dd>

Suppress warnings about use of C++;11 inheriting constructors when the
base class inherited from has a C variadic constructor; the warning is
on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Winline" class="in-doc" href="#-Winline">-Winline</a></dt><dd>

Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.

<p>The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by <span class="option">-Winline</span> to appear or disappear.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wno-invalid-offsetof" class="in-doc" href="#-Wno-invalid-offsetof">-Wno-invalid-offsetof</a> (C++; and Objective-C++; only)</dt><dd>

Suppress warnings from applying the <em>offsetof</em> macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 1998 ISO C++; standard, applying <em>offsetof</em>
to a non-POD type is undefined.  In existing C++; implementations,
however, <em>offsetof</em> typically gives meaningful results even when
applied to certain kinds of non-POD types (such as a simple
<em>struct</em> that fails to be a POD type only by virtue of having a
constructor).  This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.

<p>The restrictions on <em>offsetof</em> may be relaxed in a future version
of the C++; standard.</p>

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wvector-operation-performance" class="in-doc" href="#-Wvector-operation-performance">-Wvector-operation-performance</a></dt><dd>

Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD capabilities of the
architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
Vector operation can be implemented <em>`piecewise'</em>, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 
<em>`in parallel'</em>, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and <em>`as a single scalar'</em>, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wno-virtual-move-assign" class="in-doc" href="#-Wno-virtual-move-assign">-Wno-virtual-move-assign</a></dt><dd>

Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
non-trivial C++;11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because
if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it will be
moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the
moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is written to avoid
moving from a moved-from object, this warning can be disabled.

  </dd><dt><a id="-Wdisabled-optimization" class="in-doc" href="#-Wdisabled-optimization">-Wdisabled-optimization</a></dt><dd>

Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC's optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wpointer-sign" class="in-doc" href="#-Wpointer-sign">-Wpointer-sign</a> (C and Objective-C only)</dt><dd>

Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wall">-Wall</a></span> and by <span class="option">-Wpedantic</span>, which can be disabled with
<span class="option">-Wno-pointer-sign</span>.

Warn about string constants that are longer than the “minimum
maximum” length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.

<p>The limit applies <em>after</em> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++;98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++;.</p>

<p>This option is implied by <span class="option">-Wpedantic</span>, and can be disabled with
<span class="option">-Wno-overlength-strings</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wunsuffixed-float-constants" class="in-doc" href="#-Wunsuffixed-float-constants">-Wunsuffixed-float-constants</a> (C and Objective-C only)</dt><dd>

Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wsystem-headers">-Wsystem-headers</a></span> it

<p>
GCC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:</p>
<dl id="yui_3_17_2_1_1427238259429_260"><dt><a id="-g" class="in-doc" href="#-g">-g</a></dt><dd>

Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF 2).  GDB can work with this debugging
information.

<p>On most systems that use stabs format, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-g">-g</a></span> enables use of extra
debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in GDB but probably makes other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-gstabs">-gstabs</a>+</span>, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-gstabs">-gstabs</a></span>,
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-gxcoff">-gxcoff</a>+</span>, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-gxcoff">-gxcoff</a></span>, or <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-gvms">-gvms</a></span> (see below).</p>

<p>GCC allows you to use <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-g">-g</a></span> with
<span class="option">-O</span>.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.</p>

<p>The following options are useful when GCC is generated with the
capability for more than one debugging format.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-gsplit-dwarf" class="in-doc" href="#-gsplit-dwarf">-gsplit-dwarf</a></dt><dd>

Separate as much dwarf debugging information as possible into a
separate output file with the extension .dwo.  This option allows
the build system to avoid linking files with debug information.  To
be useful, this option requires a debugger capable of reading .dwo
files.
  </dd><dt><a id="-ggdb" class="in-doc" href="#-ggdb">-ggdb</a></dt><dd>

Produce debugging information for use by GDB.  This means to use the

if neither of those are supported), including GDB extensions if at all
possible.
  </dd><dt><a id="-gpubnames" class="in-doc" href="#-gpubnames">-gpubnames</a></dt><dd>

Generate dwarf .debug_pubnames and .debug_pubtypes sections.
  </dd><dt><a id="-gstabs" class="in-doc" href="#-gstabs">-gstabs</a></dt><dd>

Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),
without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by DBX on most BSD
systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4 systems this option
produces stabs debugging output that is not understood by DBX or SDB.
On System V Release 4 systems this option requires the GNU assembler.
  </dd><dt><a id="-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols" class="in-doc" href="#-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols">-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</a></dt><dd>

  </dd><dt><a id="-femit-class-debug-always" class="in-doc" href="#-femit-class-debug-always">-femit-class-debug-always</a></dt><dd>

Instead of emitting debugging information for a C++; class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way GCC
normally emits debugging information for classes because using this
option increases the size of debugging information by as much as a
factor of two.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fdebug-types-section" class="in-doc" href="#-fdebug-types-section">-fdebug-types-section</a></dt><dd>

When using DWARF Version 4 or higher, type DIEs can be put into
their own <em>`.debug_types'</em> section instead of making them part of the
<em>`.debug_info'</em> section.  It is more efficient to put them in a separate
comdat sections since the linker can then remove duplicates.
But not all DWARF consumers support <em>`.debug_types'</em> sections yet
and on some objects <em>`.debug_types'</em> produces larger instead of smaller
debugging information.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-gstabs">-gstabs</a>+</dt><dd>

Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is supported),

This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM RS/6000 systems.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-gxcoff">-gxcoff</a>+</dt><dd>

Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is supported),
using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU debugger (GDB).  The
use of these extensions is likely to make other debuggers crash or

assembler (GAS) to fail with an error.
  </dd><dt><a id="-gdwarf-" class="in-doc" href="#-gdwarf-">-gdwarf-</a><em><code>version</code></em></dt><dd>

Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is supported).
The value of <em>version</em> may be either 2, 3 or 4; the default version
for most targets is 4.

<p>Note that with DWARF Version 2, some ports require and always
use some non-conflicting DWARF 3 extensions in the unwind tables.</p>

<p>Version 4 may require GDB 7.0 and <span class="option">-fvar-tracking-assignments</span>
for maximum benefit.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-grecord-gcc-switches" class="in-doc" href="#-grecord-gcc-switches">-grecord-gcc-switches</a></dt><dd>

This switch causes the command-line options used to invoke the
compiler that may affect code generation to be appended to the
DW_AT_producer attribute in DWARF debugging information.  The options
are concatenated with spaces separating them from each other and from
the compiler version.  See also <span class="option">-frecord-gcc-switches</span> for another

<p>Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in

descriptions of functions and external variables, but no information
about local variables and no line numbers.</p>

<p>Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions
present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro expansion when
you use <span class="option">-g3</span>.</p>

<p><span class="option">-gdwarf-2</span> does not accept a concatenated debug level, because
GCC used to support an option <span class="option">-gdwarf</span> that meant to generate
debug information in version 1 of the DWARF format (which is very
different from version 2), and it would have been too confusing.  That
debug format is long obsolete, but the option cannot be changed now.
Instead use an additional <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-g">-g</a></span><em><code>level</code></em> option to change the
debug level for DWARF.</p>

Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
<span class="option">-fcompare-debug</span>.

If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time,
adding <em>opts</em> and <span class="option">-fcompare-debug-second</span> to the arguments
passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.

<p>If the equal sign is omitted, the default <span class="option">-gtoggle</span> is used.</p>

<p>The environment variable <em>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</em>, if defined, non-empty
and nonzero, implicitly enables <span class="option">-fcompare-debug</span>.  If
<em>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</em> is defined to a string starting with a dash,
then it is used for <em>opts</em>, otherwise the default <span class="option">-gtoggle</span>
is used.</p>

<p><span class="option">-fcompare-debug=</span>, with the equal sign but without <em>opts</em>,
is equivalent to <span class="option">-fno-compare-debug</span>, which disables the dumping
of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
<em>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</em> from taking effect.</p>

<p>To verify full coverage during <span class="option">-fcompare-debug</span> testing, set
<em>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</em> to say <span class="option">-fcompare-debug-not-overridden</span>,
which GCC rejects as an invalid option in any actual compilation
(rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
warning, setting <em>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</em> to <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-w">-w</a>%n-fcompare-debug

side-effect compiler outputs to files or to the standard output.  Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the
<em>`.gk'</em> additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.

<p>When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the

Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler generates debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.

<p>This option is a detailed version of
<span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-reduced</span> and <span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-baseonly</span>,
which serves for most needs.</p>

<p>A specification has the syntax[<em>dir:</em>|<em>ind:</em>][<em>ord:</em>|<em>gen:</em>](<em>any</em>|<em>sys</em>|<em>base</em>|<em>none</em>)</p>

<p>The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (<em>dir:</em>) or used indirectly (<em>ind:</em>).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect.
An example is
<em>struct one direct; struct two * indirect;</em>.</p>

<p>The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (<em>ord:</em>) or generic structs (<em>gen:</em>).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For C++;, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but <span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed</span> does not yet implement them.</p>

<p>The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information.
The values <em>none</em> and <em>any</em> have the normal meaning.
The value <em>base</em> means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that when compiling <em>foo.c</em>, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and <em>foo.h</em>,
but not other header files.
The value <em>sys</em> means those types satisfying <em>base</em>
or declared in system or compiler headers.</p>

<p>You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.</p>

<p>The default is <span class="option">-femit-struct-debug-detailed=all</span>.</p>

Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a
per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by appending
<span class="markup">.su</span> to the <em>auxname</em>.  <em>auxname</em> is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:
    <ul><li>
<p>The name of the function.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>A number of bytes.</p>
      </li><li>
<p>One or more qualifiers: <em>`static'</em>, <em>`dynamic'</em>, <em>`bounded'</em>.</p>
      </li></ul>
  

<p>The qualifier <em>`static'</em> means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.</p>

<p>The qualifier <em>`dynamic'</em> means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier <em>`bounded'</em> is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.

Add code so that program flow <em>arcs</em> are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
<em>auxname.gcda</em> for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (<span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span>), or for
test coverage analysis (<span class="option">-ftest-coverage</span>).  Each object file's
<em>auxname</em> is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed
(e.g. <em>foo.gcda</em> for input file <code class="filename">dir/foo.c</code>, or
<em>dir/foo.gcda</em> for output file specified as <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> dir/foo.o</span>).

      </li><li>
<p>Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
information.  This may be repeated any number of times.  You can run
concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated.  Also
<em>`fork'</em> calls are detected and correctly handled (double counting
will not happen).</p>
      </li><li>
<p>For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
the same optimization and code generation options plus
<span class="option">-fbranch-probabilities</span>.</p>

      </li></ul>
  

<p>With <span class="option">-fprofile-arcs</span>, for each function of your program GCC
creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph.
Only arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the
compiler adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are
executed.  When an arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the
instrumentation code can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic
block must be created to hold the instrumentation code.

Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified by
<em>letters</em>.  This is used for debugging the RTL-based passes of the
compiler.  The file names for most of the dumps are made by appending
a pass number and a word to the <em>dumpname</em>, and the files are
created in the directory of the output file. In case of
<em>=</em><em>filename</em> option, the dump is output on the given file
instead of the pass numbered dump files. Note that the pass number is
computed statically as passes get registered into the pass manager.
Thus the numbering is not related to the dynamic order of execution of
passes.  In particular, a pass installed by a plugin could have a
number over 200 even if it executed quite early.  <em>dumpname</em> is
generated from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified
and it is not an executable, otherwise it is the basename of the
source file. These switches may have different effects when

which control the details of the dump.  Not all options are applicable
to all dumps; those that are not meaningful are ignored.  The
following options are available
    <dl><dt><em>address</em></dt><dd>

Print the address of each node.  Usually this is not meaningful as it
changes according to the environment and source file.  Its primary use
is for tying up a dump file with a debug environment.
      </dd><dt><em>asmname</em></dt><dd>

If <em>`DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME'</em> has been set for a given decl, use that

Controls optimization dumps from various optimization passes. If the
<em>-</em><em>options</em> form is used, <em>options</em> is a list of
<em>-</em> separated options to select the dump details and
optimizations.  If <em>options</em> is not specified, it defaults to
<em>all</em> for details and <em>optall</em> for optimization
groups. If the <em>filename</em> is not specified, it defaults to
<em>stderr</em>. Note that the output <em>filename</em> will be overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, <em>stderr</em> should be used
instead.

<p>The options can be divided into two groups, 1) options describing the
verbosity of the dump, and 2) options describing which optimizations
should be included. The options from both the groups can be freely
mixed as they are non-overlapping. However, in case of any conflicts,
the latter options override the earlier options on the command
line. Though multiple -fopt-info options are accepted, only one of
them can have <em>=filename</em>. If other filenames are provided then
all but the first one are ignored.</p>

<p>The dump verbosity has the following options</p>
    <dl><dt><em>optimized</em></dt><dd>

Print information when an optimization is successfully applied. It is
up to a pass to decide which information is relevant. For example, the
vectorizer passes print the source location of loops which got
successfully vectorized.
      </dd><dt><em>missed</em></dt><dd>

Print information about missed optimizations. Individual passes
control which information to include in the output. For example,

<pre><code>gcc -O2 -ftree-vectorize -fopt-info-vec-missed</code></pre> 

<p>will print information about missed optimization opportunities from
vectorization passes on stderr.</p>
      </dd><dt><em>note</em></dt><dd>

Print verbose information about optimizations, such as certain
transformations, more detailed messages about decisions etc.
      </dd><dt><em>all</em></dt><dd>

Print detailed optimization information. This includes
<em>optimized</em>, <em>missed</em>, and <em>note</em>.
      </dd></dl>
  

<p>The second set of options describes a group of optimizations and may
include one or more of the following.</p>
    <dl><dt><em>ipa</em></dt><dd>

Enable dumps from all interprocedural optimizations.
      </dd><dt><em>loop</em></dt><dd>

Enable dumps from all loop optimizations.
      </dd><dt><em>inline</em></dt><dd>

Enable dumps from all inlining optimizations.
      </dd><dt><em>vec</em></dt><dd>

Enable dumps from all vectorization optimizations.
      </dd></dl>
     
  

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>gcc -O3 -fopt-info-missed=missed.all</code></pre> 

<p>outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
<em>missed.all</em>.</p>

<p>As another example,</p>

<pre><code>gcc -O3 -fopt-info-inline-optimized-missed=inline.txt</code></pre> 

<p>will output information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
<em>inline.txt</em>.</p>

<p>If the <em>filename</em> is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the <em>filename</em>.
Otherwise the dump is output onto <em>stderr</em>. If <em>options</em> is
omitted, it defaults to <em>all-optall</em>, which means dump all
available optimization info from all the passes. In the following
example, all optimization info is output on to <em>stderr</em>.</p>

<pre><code>gcc -O3 -fopt-info</code></pre> 

<p>Note that <span class="option">-fopt-info-vec-missed</span> behaves the same as
<span class="option">-fopt-info-missed-vec</span>.</p>

<p>As another example, consider</p>

<pre><code>gcc -fopt-info-vec-missed=vec.miss -fopt-info-loop-optimized=loop.opt</code></pre> 

<p>Here the two output filenames <em>vec.miss</em> and <em>loop.opt</em> are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only the <em>vec.miss</em> is produced which cotaints
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

diagnostic information is reported.  If <em>n</em>=1 the vectorizer
reports each loop that got vectorized, and the total number of loops
that got vectorized.  If <em>n</em>=2 the vectorizer reports locations
which could not be vectorized and the reasons for those. For any
higher verbosity levels all the analysis and transformation
information from the vectorizer is reported.

<p>Note that the information output by <span class="option">-ftree-vectorizer-verbose</span>

compiling <em>foo.c</em> with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> <a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a></span> produces files
<em>foo.i</em> and <em>foo.s</em>, as well as <em>foo.o</em>.  This creates a
preprocessed <em>foo.i</em> output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.

<p>When used in combination with the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-x">-x</a></span> command-line option,
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a></span> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a></span>.</p>

<p>If you invoke GCC in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:</p>

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a> <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> outdir1/foo.o indir1/foo.c&amp;
gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a> <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> outdir2/foo.o indir2/foo.c&amp;</code></pre> 

<p>may result in <em>foo.i</em> and <em>foo.o</em> being written to
simultaneously by both compilers.</p>
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a>=obj</dt><dd>

Store the usual “temporary” intermediate files permanently.  If the
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a></span> option is used, the temporary files are based on the
object file.  If the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a></span> option is not used, the
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a>=obj</span> switch behaves like <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a></span>.

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a>=obj <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> foo.c
gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a>=obj <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> bar.c <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> dir/xbar.o
gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a>=obj foobar.c <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> dir2/yfoobar</code></pre> 

<p>creates <em>foo.i</em>, <em>foo.s</em>, <em>dir/xbar.i</em>,
<em>dir/xbar.s</em>, <em>dir2/yfoobar.i</em>, <em>dir2/yfoobar.s</em>, and
<em>dir2/yfoobar.o</em>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-time" class="in-doc" href="#-time">-time</a>[<em>=</em><em>file</em>]</dt><dd>

Report the CPU time taken by each subprocess in the compilation
sequence.  For C source files, this is the compiler proper and assembler
(plus the linker if linking is done).

<p>Without the specification of an output file, the output looks like this:</p>

<pre><code># cc1 0.12 0.01
# as 0.00 0.01</code></pre> 

<p>The first number on each line is the “user time”, that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is “system time”,
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.</p>

<p>With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>0.12 0.01 cc1 &lt;options&gt;
0.00 0.01 as &lt;options&gt;</code></pre> 

<p>The “user time” and the “system time” are moved before the program

can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which options.</p>

Normally, when producing DWARF 2 output, GCC avoids producing debug symbol 
output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
Sometimes it is useful to have GCC emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example 
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.

</div>

<div class="subsection" id="Options-Options_That_Control_Optimization"><a href="#Options-Options_That_Control_Optimization"><h3>Options That Control Optimization</h3></a>
<p>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.</p>

<p>Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.</p>

<p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.</p>

<p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.</p>

<p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.</p>

<p>Most optimizations are only enabled if an <span class="option">-O</span> level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.</p>

<p>Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <span class="option">-O</span> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with <span class="option">-Q <a class="in-doc" href="#--help">--help</a>=optimizers</span>
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.</p>
<dl><dt><a id="-O" class="in-doc" href="#-O">-O</a></dt>


  <dt><a id="-O1" class="in-doc" href="#-O1">-O1</a></dt><dd>


Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.

<p>With <span class="option">-O</span>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.</p>

<p><span class="option">-O</span> turns on the following optimization flags:</p>

<p><span class="option">-fauto-inc-dec 
-fcompare-elim 
-fcprop-registers 
-fdce 
-fdefer-pop

-ftree-slsr 
-ftree-sra 
-ftree-pta 
-ftree-ter 
-funit-at-a-time</span></p>

<p><span class="option">-O</span> also turns on <span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-O2" class="in-doc" href="#-O2">-O2</a></dt><dd>

Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
As compared to <span class="option">-O</span>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.

<p><span class="option">-O2</span> turns on all optimization flags specified by <span class="option">-O</span>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
<span class="option">-fthread-jumps 
<a class="in-doc" href="#-falign-functions">-falign-functions</a>  <a class="in-doc" href="#-falign-jumps">-falign-jumps</a>

  </dd><dt><a id="-O3" class="in-doc" href="#-O3">-O3</a></dt><dd>

Optimize for size.  <span class="option">-Os</span> enables all <span class="option">-O2</span> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.

<p><span class="option">-Os</span> disables the following optimization flags:
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-falign-functions">-falign-functions</a>  <a class="in-doc" href="#-falign-jumps">-falign-jumps</a>  <a class="in-doc" href="#-falign-loops">-falign-loops</a>

Disregard strict standards compliance.  <span class="option">-Ofast</span> enables all
<span class="option">-O3</span> optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard-compliant programs.
It turns on <span class="option">-ffast-math</span> and the Fortran-specific
<span class="option">-fno-protect-parens</span> and <span class="option">-fstack-arrays</span>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Og" class="in-doc" href="#-Og">-Og</a></dt><dd>

Optimize debugging experience.  <span class="option">-Og</span> enables optimizations
that do not interfere with debugging. It should be the optimization
level of choice for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering
a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation
and a good debugging experience.

<p>If you use multiple <span class="option">-O</span> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.</p>

<p>Options of the form <span class="option">-f</span><em><code>flag</code></em> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <span class="option">-ffoo</span> is <span class="option">-fno-foo</span>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed---the one you typically 
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing <em>no-</em>
or adding it.</p>

<p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <span class="option">-O</span> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when “fine-tuning” of
optimizations to be performed is desired.</p>
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-fno-default-inline">-fno-default-inline</a></dt><dd>

Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++; only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<span class="option">-O</span>, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled

the member function name.

such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
<span class="option">-ffp-contract=on</span> enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented

  </dd><dt><a id="-fomit-frame-pointer" class="in-doc" href="#-fomit-frame-pointer">-fomit-frame-pointer</a></dt><dd>

Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <em>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</em>

<p>On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
machine-description macro <em>`FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED'</em> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.</p>

<p>Starting with GCC version 4.6, the default setting (when not optimizing for
size) for 32-bit GNU/Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86 targets has been changed to
<span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span>.  The default can be reverted to

For front-ends that support it (C and C++;), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/C++;
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (<em>libmudflap</em>), which is linked into a program if
<span class="option">-fmudflap</span> is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the <em>MUDFLAP_OPTIONS</em>

In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump instructions

This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed
integer overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.  The bounds for the
number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling

Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that

  </dd><dt><a id="-floop-interchange" class="in-doc" href="#-floop-interchange">-floop-interchange</a></dt><dd>

Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging two
nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example, given a
loop like:

<pre><code>DO J = 1, M
  DO I = 1, N
    A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C

<p>which can be beneficial when <em>`N'</em> is larger than the caches,
because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This optimization
applies to all the languages supported by GCC and is not limited to
Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC has to be configured
with <span class="option">--with-ppl</span> and <span class="option">--with-cloog</span> to enable the
Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.</p>

Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed

Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip mines
each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the
element loops fit inside caches.  The strip length can be changed
using the <em>loop-block-tile-size</em> parameter.  For example, given
a loop like:

<pre><code>DO I = 1, N
  DO J = 1, M
    A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
  ENDDO
ENDDO</code></pre> 
<p>loop blocking transforms the loop as if it were written:</p>

<pre><code>DO II = 1, N, 51
  DO JJ = 1, M, 51
    DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
      DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 50, M)
        A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
      ENDDO
    ENDDO
  ENDDO
ENDDO</code></pre> 
<p>which can be beneficial when <em>`M'</em> is larger than the caches,
because the innermost loop iterates over a smaller amount of data
which can be kept in the caches.  This optimization applies to all the

  </dd><dt><a id="-fstrict-aliasing" class="in-doc" href="#-fstrict-aliasing">-fstrict-aliasing</a></dt><dd>

Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++;), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <em>`unsigned int'</em> can alias an <em>`int'</em>, but not a
<em>`void*'</em> or a <em>`double'</em>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

<p>Pay special attention to code like this:</p>

<pre><code></code></pre> 
<p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called “type-punning”) is common.  Even with
<span class="option">-fstrict-aliasing</span>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.    However, this code might not:</p>

<pre><code>int f() {
  union a_union t;
  int* ip;
  t.d = 3.0;
  ip = &amp;t.i;
  return *ip;
}</code></pre> 
<p>Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>int f() {

  double d = 3.0;

  return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i;<br>
}</code></pre>

  </dd><dt><a id="-fstrict-overflow" class="in-doc" href="#-fstrict-overflow">-fstrict-overflow</a></dt><dd>

Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and C++;) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it does not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler assumes
that an expression like <em>`i + 10 &gt; i'</em> is always true for
signed <em>`i'</em>.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if <em>`i + 10'</em> overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers 
overflows must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.

<p>This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that <em>`p + u &gt;
p'</em> is always true for a pointer <em>`p'</em> and unsigned integer
<em>`u'</em>.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if <em>`p + u'</em> overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.</p>

<p>See also the <span class="option">-fwrapv</span> option.  Using <span class="option">-fwrapv</span> means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
<span class="option">-fwrapv</span> is used, there is no difference between
<span class="option">-fstrict-overflow</span> and <span class="option">-fno-strict-overflow</span> for
integers.  With <span class="option">-fwrapv</span> certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
<span class="option">-fwrapv</span>, but not otherwise.</p>

<p>The <span class="option">-fstrict-overflow</span> option is enabled at levels
<span class="option">-O2</span>, <span class="option">-O3</span>, <span class="option">-Os</span>.</p>

Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being

information.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-flto" class="in-doc" href="#-flto">-flto</a>[=<em><code>n</code></em><em>]</em></dt><dd>

This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.

<p>To use the link-time optimizer, <span class="option">-flto</span> needs to be specified at
compile time and during the final link.  For example:</p>

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -O2 -flto foo.c
gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -O2 -flto bar.c
gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o</code></pre> 

<p>The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation
of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <em>foo.o</em> and
<em>bar.o</em>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from
<em>foo.o</em> and <em>bar.o</em>, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
<em>foo.o</em> and <em>bar.o</em> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
<em>bar.o</em> into functions in <em>foo.o</em> and vice-versa.</p>

<p>Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:</p>

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c</code></pre> 

<p>The above generates bytecode for <em>foo.c</em> and <em>bar.c</em>,
merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce <em>myprog</em>.</p>

<p>The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations the <span class="option">-flto</span> flag needs to be passed to both the
compile and the link commands.</p>

<p>To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see <span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span>) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, <span class="option">-fwhole-program</span> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.</p>

<p>Note that when a file is compiled with <span class="option">-flto</span>, the generated
object file is larger than a regular object file because it 
contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual final code.  This means that
object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object
files; if <span class="option">-flto</span> is not passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.</p>

<p>Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,</p>

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -O0 -flto foo.c
gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -O0 -flto bar.c
gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o</code></pre> 

<p>This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary <em>myprog</em> is optimized at
<span class="option">-O3</span>.  If, instead, the final binary is generated without
<span class="option">-flto</span>, then <em>myprog</em> is not optimized.</p>

<p>When producing the final binary with <span class="option">-flto</span>, GCC only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC automatically selects
which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without
further processing.</p>

<p>There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Currently, the following options are saved into the GIMPLE
bytecode files: <span class="option">-fPIC</span>, <span class="option">-fcommon</span> and all the
<span class="option">-m</span> target flags.</p>

<p>At link time, these options are read in and reapplied.  Note that the
current implementation makes no attempt to recognize conflicting
values for these options.  If different files have conflicting option
values (e.g., one file is compiled with <span class="option">-fPIC</span> and another
isn't), the compiler simply uses the last value read from the
bytecode files.  It is recommended, then, that you compile all the files
participating in the same link with the same options.</p>

<p>If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.</p>

<p>Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages.  This requires
support in the language front end.  Currently, the C, C++; and
Fortran front ends are capable of emitting GIMPLE bytecodes, so
something like this should work:</p>

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -flto foo.c
g++ <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -flto bar.cc
gfortran <a class="in-doc" href="#-c">-c</a> -flto baz.f90
g++ <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran</code></pre> 

<p>Notice that the final link is done with <em>g++</em> to get the C++;
runtime libraries and <span class="option">-lgfortran</span> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation; all you need to add is <span class="option">-flto</span> to
all the compile and link commands.</p>

<p>If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
<em>libfoo.a</em>, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To enable this feature, use
the flag <span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span> at link time:</p>

<pre><code>gcc <a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo</code></pre> 

<p>With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
GIMPLE files from <em>libfoo.a</em> and passes them on to the running GCC
to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.</p>

<p>If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <em>libfoo.a</em>
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the LTO optimization process.</p>

<p>Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <span class="option">-flto</span> and <span class="option">-fwhole-program</span> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of <span class="option">-fwhole-program</span> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see <span class="option">-fuse-linker-plugin</span>).</p>

<p>The current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
GCC will not work with an older/newer version of GCC.</p>

<p>Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information.  Combining <span class="option">-flto</span> with
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-g">-g</a></span> is currently experimental and expected to produce wrong
results.</p>

<p>If you specify the optional <em>n</em>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <em>n</em>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <em>make</em> program.  The
environment variable <em>MAKE</em> may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for <em>n</em> is 1.</p>

<p>You can also specify <span class="option">-flto=jobserver</span> to use GNU make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This

<p>This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out

more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic

libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to <em>`-fwhole-program'</em>.
See <span class="option">-flto</span> for a description of the effect of this flag and how to

Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language

<p><span class="option">-fno-fat-lto-objects</span> improves compilation time over plain LTO, but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
<em>nm</em>, <em>ar</em> and <em>ranlib</em>
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  GCC provides the <em>gcc-ar</em>,

Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other

<p>This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <em>`double'</em> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only

This option allows further control over excess precision on machines

<em>`float'</em> and <em>`double'</em> types and the processor does not
support operations rounding to those types.  By default,
<span class="option">-fexcess-precision=fast</span> is in effect; this means that
operations are carried out in the precision of the registers and that
it is unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
code takes place.  When compiling C, if
<span class="option">-fexcess-precision=standard</span> is specified then excess
precision follows the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas <span class="option">-ffloat-store</span> only affects

vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call <em>`alloca'</em>, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.

Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared “anchor” symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on some
targets.

<p>For example, the implementation of the following function <em>`foo'</em>:</p>

<pre><code>static int a, b, c;

int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }</code></pre> 
<p>usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <span class="option">-fsection-anchors</span>, it accesses the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):</p>

<pre><code>int <span class="func-name">foo</span>(<var>void</var>);<br><br>
        {<br>
          register int *xr = &amp;x;<br>
          return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];<br>
        }</code></pre> 
<p>Not all targets support this option.</p>

In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, GCC does not inline functions
that contain more than a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command line using the
<span class="option">--param</span> option.

<p>The names of specific parameters, and the meaning of the values, are
tied to the internals of the compiler, and are subject to change
without notice in future releases.</p>

<p>In each case, the <em>value</em> is an integer.  The allowable choices for
<em>name</em> are:</p>
    <dl><dt><em>predictable-branch-outcome</em></dt><dd>

When branch is predicted to be taken with probability lower than this threshold
(in percent), then it is considered well predictable. The default is 10.
      </dd><dt><em>max-crossjump-edges</em></dt><dd>

The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping.
The algorithm used by <span class="option">-fcrossjumping</span> is O(N^2) in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
      </dd><dt><em>min-crossjump-insns</em></dt><dd>

The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end
of two blocks before cross-jumping is performed on them.  This
value is ignored in the case where all instructions in the block being
cross-jumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.
      </dd><dt><em>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</em></dt><dd>

The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.
      </dd><dt><em>max-goto-duplication-insns</em></dt><dd>

The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid O(N^2) behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
      </dd><dt><em>max-delay-slot-insn-search</em></dt><dd>

The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions are searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
are minimal, so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.
      </dd><dt><em>max-delay-slot-live-search</em></dt><dd>

When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
      </dd><dt><em>max-gcse-memory</em></dt><dd>

The approximate maximum amount of memory that can be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization is not done.
      </dd><dt><em>max-gcse-insertion-ratio</em></dt><dd>

If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value
for any expression, then RTL PRE inserts or removes the expression and thus
leaves partially redundant computations in the instruction stream.  The default value is 20.
      </dd><dt><em>max-pending-list-length</em></dt><dd>

The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling allows
before flushing the current state and starting over.  Large functions
with few branches or calls can create excessively large lists which
needlessly consume memory and resources.
      </dd><dt><em>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts</em></dt><dd>

The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make
when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can exponentially increase
compilation time.
      </dd><dt><em>max-inline-insns-single</em></dt><dd>

Several parameters control the tree inliner used in GCC.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC's
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner
considers for inlining.  This only affects functions declared
inline and methods implemented in a class declaration (C++;).
The default value is 400.
      </dd><dt><em>max-inline-insns-auto</em></dt><dd>

When you use <span class="option">-finline-functions</span> (included in <span class="option">-O3</span>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining
by the compiler are investigated.  To those functions, a different
(more restrictive) limit compared to functions declared inline can
be applied.
The default value is 40.
      </dd><dt><em>inline-min-speedup</em></dt><dd>

When estimated performance improvement of caller + callee runtime exceeds this
threshold (in precent), the function can be inlined regardless the limit on
<span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-single</span> and <span class="option">--param
max-inline-insns-auto</span>.
      </dd><dt><em>large-function-insns</em></dt><dd>

The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this
limit after inlining, inlining is constrained by
<span class="option">--param large-function-growth</span>.  This parameter is useful primarily
to avoid extreme compilation time caused by non-linear algorithms used by the
back end.
The default value is 2700.
      </dd><dt><em>large-function-growth</em></dt><dd>

Specifies maximal growth of large function caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 100 which limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
      </dd><dt><em>large-unit-insns</em></dt><dd>

The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by <span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span>.
For small units this might be too tight.
For example, consider a unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <span class="option">--param large-unit-insns</span>
before applying <span class="option">--param inline-unit-growth</span>.  The default is 10000.
      </dd><dt><em>inline-unit-growth</em></dt><dd>

Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by inlining.
The default value is 30 which limits unit growth to 1.3 times the original
size.
      </dd><dt><em>ipcp-unit-growth</em></dt><dd>

Specifies maximal overall growth of the compilation unit caused by
interprocedural constant propagation.  The default value is 10 which limits
unit growth to 1.1 times the original size.
      </dd><dt><em>large-stack-frame</em></dt><dd>

The limit specifying large stack frames.  While inlining the algorithm is trying
to not grow past this limit too much.  The default value is 256 bytes.
      </dd><dt><em>large-stack-frame-growth</em></dt><dd>

Specifies maximal growth of large stack frames caused by inlining in percents.
The default value is 1000 which limits large stack frame growth to 11 times
the original size.

      <dt><em>max-inline-insns-recursive-auto</em></dt><dd>


Specifies the maximum number of instructions an out-of-line copy of a
self-recursive inline
function can grow into by performing recursive inlining.

<p>For functions declared inline, <span class="option">--param max-inline-insns-recursive</span> is
taken into account.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <span class="option">-finline-functions</span> (included in <span class="option">-O3</span>) is

default value is 450.</p>
      </dd><dt><em>max-inline-recursive-depth</em></dt>


      <dt><em>max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</em></dt><dd>


Specifies the maximum recursion depth used for recursive inlining.

<p>For functions declared inline, <span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth</span> is
taken into account.  For functions not declared inline, recursive inlining
happens only when <span class="option">-finline-functions</span> (included in <span class="option">-O3</span>) is
enabled and <span class="option">--param max-inline-recursive-depth-auto</span> is used.  The
default value is 8.</p>
      </dd><dt><em>min-inline-recursive-probability</em></dt><dd>

Recursive inlining is profitable only for function having deep recursion
in average and can hurt for function having little recursion depth by
increasing the prologue size or complexity of function body to other
optimizers.

<p>When profile feedback is available (see <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-fprofile-generate">-fprofile-generate</a></span>) the actual
recursion depth can be guessed from probability that function recurses via a
given call expression.  This parameter limits inlining only to call expressions
whose probability exceeds the given threshold (in percents).
The default value is 10.</p>
      </dd><dt><em>early-inlining-insns</em></dt><dd>

Specify growth that the early inliner can make.  In effect it increases
the amount of inlining for code having a large abstraction penalty.
The default value is 10.
      </dd><dt><em>max-early-inliner-iterations</em></dt>


      <dt><em>max-early-inliner-iterations</em></dt><dd>


Limit of iterations of the early inliner.  This basically bounds
the number of nested indirect calls the early inliner can resolve.
Deeper chains are still handled by late inlining.

      <dt><em>comdat-sharing-probability</em></dt><dd>


Probability (in percent) that C++; inline function with comdat visibility
are shared across multiple compilation units.  The default value is 20.
      </dd><dt><em>min-vect-loop-bound</em></dt><dd>

The minimum number of iterations under which loops are not vectorized
when <span class="option">-ftree-vectorize</span> is used.  The number of iterations after
vectorization needs to be greater than the value specified by this option
to allow vectorization.  The default value is 0.
      </dd><dt><em>gcse-cost-distance-ratio</em></dt><dd>

Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by GCSE optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the
code hoisting pass.  The bigger the ratio, the more aggressive code hoisting
is with simple expressions, i.e., the expressions that have cost
less than <em>gcse-unrestricted-cost</em>.  Specifying 0 disables
hoisting of simple expressions.  The default value is 10.
      </dd><dt><em>gcse-unrestricted-cost</em></dt><dd>

Cost, roughly measured as the cost of a single typical machine
instruction, at which GCSE optimizations do not constrain
the distance an expression can travel.  This is currently
supported only in the code hoisting pass.  The lesser the cost,
the more aggressive code hoisting is.  Specifying 0 
allows all expressions to travel unrestricted distances.
The default value is 3.
      </dd><dt><em>max-hoist-depth</em></dt><dd>

The depth of search in the dominator tree for expressions to hoist.
This is used to avoid quadratic behavior in hoisting algorithm.

The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and
another loop with unknown bound.
The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while
the unknown number of iterations average to roughly 10.  This means that the

This value is used to limit superblock formation once the given percentage of

expansion.

<p>The <em>tracer-dynamic-coverage-feedback</em> is used only when profile

The default is 1000.
      </dd><dt><em>ggc-min-expand</em></dt><dd>

GCC uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.

<p>The default is 30% + 70% * (RAM/1GB) with an upper bound of 100% when
RAM &gt;= 1GB.  If <em>`getrlimit'</em> is available, the notion of “RAM” is
the smallest of actual RAM and <em>`RLIMIT_DATA'</em> or <em>`RLIMIT_AS'</em>.  If
GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
<em>ggc-min-heapsize</em> to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.</p>
      </dd><dt><em>ggc-min-heapsize</em></dt><dd>

Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by <em>ggc-min-expand</em>% beyond <em>ggc-min-heapsize</em>.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.

<p>The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit that
tries to ensure that RLIMIT_DATA or RLIMIT_AS are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If GCC is not able to calculate RAM on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this
parameter and <em>ggc-min-expand</em> to zero causes a full collection
to occur at every opportunity.</p>

Used by the basic block reordering pass to decide whether to use unconditional

<p>The <em>reorder-block-duplicate-feedback</em> is used only when profile

The minimum size of buffers (i.e. arrays) that receive stack smashing
protection when <span class="option">-fstack-protection</span> is used.
      </dd><dt><em>max-jump-thread-duplication-stmts</em></dt><dd>

Maximum number of statements allowed in a block that needs to be
duplicated when threading jumps.
      </dd><dt><em>max-fields-for-field-sensitive</em></dt><dd>

Maximum number of fields in a structure treated in
a field sensitive manner during pointer analysis.  The default is zero
for <span class="option">-O0</span> and <span class="option">-O1</span>,
and 100 for <span class="option">-Os</span>, <span class="option">-O2</span>, and <span class="option">-O3</span>.
      </dd><dt><em>prefetch-latency</em></dt><dd>

Estimate on average number of instructions that are executed before
prefetch finishes.  The distance prefetched ahead is proportional
to this constant.  Increasing this number may also lead to less
streams being prefetched (see <em>simultaneous-prefetches</em>).
      </dd><dt><em>simultaneous-prefetches</em></dt><dd>

Maximum number of prefetches that can run at the same time.
      </dd><dt><em>l1-cache-line-size</em></dt><dd>

The size of cache line in L1 cache, in bytes.
      </dd><dt><em>l1-cache-size</em></dt><dd>

The size of L1 cache, in kilobytes.
      </dd><dt><em>l2-cache-size</em></dt><dd>

The size of L2 cache, in kilobytes.
      </dd><dt><em>min-insn-to-prefetch-ratio</em></dt><dd>

The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of prefetches to enable prefetching in a loop.
      </dd><dt><em>prefetch-min-insn-to-mem-ratio</em></dt><dd>

The minimum ratio between the number of instructions and the
number of memory references to enable prefetching in a loop.
      </dd><dt><em>use-canonical-types</em></dt><dd>

Whether the compiler should use the “canonical” type system.  By
default, this should always be 1, which uses a more efficient internal
mechanism for comparing types in C++; and Objective-C++;.  However, if
bugs in the canonical type system are causing compilation failures,
set this value to 0 to disable canonical types.
      </dd><dt><em>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</em></dt><dd>

Switch initialization conversion refuses to create arrays that are
bigger than <em>switch-conversion-max-branch-ratio</em> times the number of
branches in the switch.
      </dd><dt><em>max-partial-antic-length</em></dt><dd>

Maximum length of the partial antic set computed during the tree
partial redundancy elimination optimization (<span class="option">-ftree-pre</span>) when
optimizing at <span class="option">-O3</span> and above.  For some sorts of source code
the enhanced partial redundancy elimination optimization can run away,
consuming all of the memory available on the host machine.  This
parameter sets a limit on the length of the sets that are computed,
which prevents the runaway behavior.  Setting a value of 0 for
this parameter allows an unlimited set length.
      </dd><dt><em>sccvn-max-scc-size</em></dt><dd>

Maximum size of a strongly connected component (SCC) during SCCVN
processing.  If this limit is hit, SCCVN processing for the whole
function is not done and optimizations depending on it are
disabled.  The default maximum SCC size is 10000.
      </dd><dt><em>sccvn-max-alias-queries-per-access</em></dt><dd>

Maximum number of alias-oracle queries we perform when looking for
redundancies for loads and stores.  If this limit is hit the search
is aborted and the load or store is not considered redundant.  The
number of queries is algorithmically limited to the number of
stores on all paths from the load to the function entry.
The default maxmimum number of queries is 1000.
      </dd><dt><em>ira-max-loops-num</em></dt><dd>

IRA uses regional register allocation by default.  If a function
contains more loops than the number given by this parameter, only at most
the given number of the most frequently-executed loops form regions
for regional register allocation.  The default value of the
parameter is 100.
      </dd><dt><em>ira-max-conflict-table-size</em></dt><dd>

Although IRA uses a sophisticated algorithm to compress the conflict
table, the table can still require excessive amounts of memory for
huge functions.  If the conflict table for a function could be more
than the size in MB given by this parameter, the register allocator
instead uses a faster, simpler, and lower-quality
algorithm that does not require building a pseudo-register conflict table.  
The default value of the parameter is 2000.
      </dd><dt><em>ira-loop-reserved-regs</em></dt><dd>

IRA can be used to evaluate more accurate register pressure in loops
for decisions to move loop invariants (see <span class="option">-O3</span>).  The number
of available registers reserved for some other purposes is given
by this parameter.  The default value of the parameter is 2, which is
the minimal number of registers needed by typical instructions.
This value is the best found from numerous experiments.
      </dd><dt><em>loop-invariant-max-bbs-in-loop</em></dt><dd>

Loop invariant motion can be very expensive, both in compilation time and
in amount of needed compile-time memory, with very large loops.  Loops
with more basic blocks than this parameter won't have loop invariant
motion optimization performed on them.  The default value of the
parameter is 1000 for <span class="option">-O1</span> and 10000 for <span class="option">-O2</span> and above.
      </dd><dt><em>loop-max-datarefs-for-datadeps</em></dt><dd>

Building data dapendencies is expensive for very large loops.  This
parameter limits the number of data references in loops that are
considered for data dependence analysis.  These large loops are no
handled by the optimizations using loop data dependencies.
The default value is 1000.
      </dd><dt><em>max-vartrack-size</em></dt><dd>

Sets a maximum number of hash table slots to use during variable
tracking dataflow analysis of any function.  If this limit is exceeded
with variable tracking at assignments enabled, analysis for that
function is retried without it, after removing all debug insns from
the function.  If the limit is exceeded even without debug insns, var
tracking analysis is completely disabled for the function.  Setting
the parameter to zero makes it unlimited.
      </dd><dt><em>max-vartrack-expr-depth</em></dt><dd>

Sets a maximum number of recursion levels when attempting to map
variable names or debug temporaries to value expressions.  This trades
compilation time for more complete debug information.  If this is set too
low, value expressions that are available and could be represented in
debug information may end up not being used; setting this higher may
enable the compiler to find more complex debug expressions, but compile
time and memory use may grow.  The default is 12.
      </dd><dt><em>min-nondebug-insn-uid</em></dt><dd>

Use uids starting at this parameter for nondebug insns.  The range below
the parameter is reserved exclusively for debug insns created by
<span class="option">-fvar-tracking-assignments</span>, but debug insns may get
(non-overlapping) uids above it if the reserved range is exhausted.
      </dd><dt><em>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</em></dt><dd>

IPA-SRA replaces a pointer to an aggregate with one or more new
parameters only when their cumulative size is less or equal to
<em>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</em> times the size of the original
pointer parameter.
      </dd><dt><em>tm-max-aggregate-size</em></dt><dd>

When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this
parameter specifies the size in bytes after which variables are
saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore code
sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using
<span class="option">-fgnu-tm</span>.
      </dd><dt><em>graphite-max-nb-scop-params</em></dt><dd>

To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.  The
default value is 10 parameters.  A variable whose value is unknown at
compilation time and defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.
      </dd><dt><em>graphite-max-bbs-per-function</em></dt><dd>

To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the size of
the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded.  The default value is
100 basic blocks.
      </dd><dt><em>loop-block-tile-size</em></dt><dd>

Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
<span class="option">-floop-block</span> or <span class="option">-floop-strip-mine</span>, strip mine each
loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
length can be changed using the <em>loop-block-tile-size</em>
parameter.  The default value is 51 iterations.
      </dd><dt><em>ipa-cp-value-list-size</em></dt><dd>

IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed to a function's
parameter in order to propagate them and perform devirtualization.
<em>ipa-cp-value-list-size</em> is the maximum number of values and types it
stores per one formal parameter of a function.
      </dd><dt><em>lto-partitions</em></dt><dd>

Specify desired number of partitions produced during WHOPR compilation.
The number of partitions should exceed the number of CPUs used for compilation.
The default value is 32.
      </dd><dt><em>lto-minpartition</em></dt><dd>

Size of minimal partition for WHOPR (in estimated instructions).
This prevents expenses of splitting very small programs into too many
partitions.
      </dd><dt><em>cxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help</em></dt><dd>

The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions when C++;
name lookup fails for an identifier.  The default is 1000.
      </dd><dt><em>sink-frequency-threshold</em></dt><dd>

The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of the target block
relative to a statement's original block to allow statement sinking of a
statement.  Larger numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking.
The default value is 75.  A small positive adjustment is applied for
statements with memory operands as those are even more profitable so sink.
      </dd><dt><em>max-stores-to-sink</em></dt><dd>

The maximum number of conditional stores paires that can be sunk.  Set to 0
if either vectorization (<span class="option">-ftree-vectorize</span>) or if-conversion
(<span class="option">-ftree-loop-if-convert</span>) is disabled.  The default is 2.
      </dd><dt><em>allow-load-data-races</em></dt><dd>

Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on loads.
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
unless implicitly set by the <span class="option">-fmemory-model=</span> option.
      </dd><dt><em>allow-store-data-races</em></dt><dd>

Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on stores.
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
unless implicitly set by the <span class="option">-fmemory-model=</span> option.
      </dd><dt><em>allow-packed-load-data-races</em></dt><dd>

Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data loads.
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
unless implicitly set by the <span class="option">-fmemory-model=</span> option.
      </dd><dt><em>allow-packed-store-data-races</em></dt><dd>

Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data stores.
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
unless implicitly set by the <span class="option">-fmemory-model=</span> option.
      </dd><dt><em>case-values-threshold</em></dt><dd>

The smallest number of different values for which it is best to use a
jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches.  If the value is
0, use the default for the machine.  The default is 0.
      </dd><dt><em>tree-reassoc-width</em></dt><dd>

Set the maximum number of instructions executed in parallel in
reassociated tree. This parameter overrides target dependent
heuristics used by default if has non zero value.
      </dd><dt><em>sched-pressure-algorithm</em></dt><dd>

Choose between the two available implementations of
<span class="option">-fsched-pressure</span>.  Algorithm 1 is the original implementation
and is the more likely to prevent instructions from being reordered.
Algorithm 2 was designed to be a compromise between the relatively
conservative approach taken by algorithm 1 and the rather aggressive
approach taken by the default scheduler.  It relies more heavily on
having a regular register file and accurate register pressure classes.
See <em>haifa-sched.c</em> in the GCC sources for more details.

<p>The default choice depends on the target.</p>
      </dd><dt><em>max-slsr-cand-scan</em></dt><dd>

<div class="subsection" id="Options-Options_Controlling_the_Preprocessor"><a href="#Options-Options_Controlling_the_Preprocessor"><h3>Options Controlling the Preprocessor</h3></a>
<p>
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.</p>

<p>If you use the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span> option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span> because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.</p>
<dl><dt><a id="-Wp" class="in-doc" href="#-Wp">-Wp</a>,<em><code>option</code></em></dt><dd>

You can use <span class="option">-Wp,</span><em><code>option</code></em> to bypass the compiler driver
and pass <em>option</em> directly through to the preprocessor.  If
<em>option</em> contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
<span class="option">-Wp</span> forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using <span class="option">-Wp</span> and let the driver handle the
options instead.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Xpreprocessor" class="in-doc" href="#-Xpreprocessor">-Xpreprocessor</a> <em><code>option</code></em></dt><dd>

Pass <em>option</em> as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options that GCC does not 
recognize.

<p>If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
<span class="option">-Xpreprocessor</span> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-no-integrated-cpp" class="in-doc" href="#-no-integrated-cpp">-no-integrated-cpp</a></dt><dd>

Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
By default, GCC performs preprocessing as an integrated part of
input tokenization and parsing.
If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end
(<em>cc1</em>, <em>cc1plus</em>, or <em>cc1obj</em> for C, C++;,
and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation
of the preprocessed input.
This option may be useful in conjunction with the <span class="option">-B</span> or
<span class="option">-wrapper</span> options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.
  </dd><dt><a id="-D" class="in-doc" href="#-D">-D</a> <em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Predefine <em>name</em> as a macro, with definition <em>1</em>.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-D">-D</a> <em><code>name</code></em><em>=</em><em>definition</em></dt><dd>

The contents of <em>definition</em> are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a <em>#define</em>
directive.  In particular, the definition will be truncated by
embedded newline characters.

<p>If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.</p>

<p>If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option.  With <em>sh</em> and <em>csh</em>,
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-D">-D</a>'</span><em><code>name</code></em><em>(</em><em>args...</em><em>)=</em><em>definition</em><em>'</em> works.</p>

<p><span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-D">-D</a></span> and <span class="option">-U</span> options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All <span class="option">-imacros</span> <em><code>file</code></em> and
<span class="option">-include</span> <em><code>file</code></em> options are processed after all
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-D">-D</a></span> and <span class="option">-U</span> options.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-U" class="in-doc" href="#-U">-U</a> <em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Cancel any previous definition of <em>name</em>, either built in or
provided with a <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-D">-D</a></span> option.
  </dd><dt><a id="-undef" class="in-doc" href="#-undef">-undef</a></dt><dd>

Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
  </dd><dt><a id="-I" class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a> <em><code>dir</code></em></dt><dd>

Add the directory <em>dir</em> to the list of directories to be searched
for header files.
Directories named by <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span> are searched before the standard
system include directories.  If the directory <em>dir</em> is a standard
system include directory, the option is ignored to ensure that the
default search order for system directories and the special treatment
of system headers are not defeated
.
If <em>dir</em> begins with <em>`='</em>, then the <em>`='</em> will be replaced
by the sysroot prefix; see <span class="option">--sysroot</span> and <span class="option">-isysroot</span>.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a> <em><code>file</code></em></dt><dd>

Write output to <em>file</em>.  This is the same as specifying <em>file</em>
as the second non-option argument to <em>cpp</em>.  <code>gcc</code> has a
different interpretation of a second non-option argument, so you must
use <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a></span> to specify the output file.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wall">-Wall</a></dt><dd>

Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code.
At present this is <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wcomment">-Wcomment</a></span>, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wtrigraphs">-Wtrigraphs</a></span>,
<span class="option">-Wmultichar</span> and a warning about integer promotion causing a
change of sign in <em>`#if'</em> expressions.  Note that many of the
preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to
control them.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wcomment">-Wcomment</a></dt>


  <dt><a id="-Wcomments" class="in-doc" href="#-Wcomments">-Wcomments</a></dt><dd>


Warn whenever a comment-start sequence <code class="filename">/*</code> appears in a <code class="filename">/*</code>
comment, or whenever a backslash-newline appears in a <code class="filename">//</code> comment.
(Both forms have the same effect.)
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wtrigraphs">-Wtrigraphs</a></dt><dd>

Most trigraphs in comments cannot affect the meaning of the program.
However, a trigraph that would form an escaped newline (<em>??/</em> at
the end of a line) can, by changing where the comment begins or ends.
Therefore, only trigraphs that would form escaped newlines produce
warnings inside a comment.

<p>This option is implied by <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wall">-Wall</a></span>.  If <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wall">-Wall</a></span> is not
given, this option is still enabled unless trigraphs are enabled.  To
get trigraph conversion without warnings, but get the other
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wall">-Wall</a></span> warnings, use <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-trigraphs">-trigraphs</a> <a class="in-doc" href="#-Wall">-Wall</a> -Wno-trigraphs</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wtraditional">-Wtraditional</a></dt><dd>

Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and problematic constructs which should be avoided.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wundef">-Wundef</a></dt><dd>

Warn whenever an identifier which is not a macro is encountered in an
<em>#if</em> directive, outside of <em>defined</em>.  Such identifiers are
replaced with zero.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wunused-macros" class="in-doc" href="#-Wunused-macros">-Wunused-macros</a></dt><dd>

Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro
is <em>used</em> if it is expanded or tested for existence at least once.
The preprocessor will also warn if the macro has not been used at the
time it is redefined or undefined.

<p>Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros
defined in include files are not warned about.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped
conditional blocks, then CPP will report it as unused.  To avoid the
warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the macro's
definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.
Alternatively, you could provide a dummy use with something like:</p>

<pre><code>#if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
#endif</code></pre> 
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wendif-labels" class="in-doc" href="#-Wendif-labels">-Wendif-labels</a></dt><dd>

Warn whenever an <em>#else</em> or an <em>#endif</em> are followed by text.
This usually happens in code of the form

<pre><code>#if FOO
...
#else FOO
...
#endif FOO</code></pre> 

<p>The second and third <em>`FOO'</em> should be in comments, but often are not
in older programs.  This warning is on by default.</p>
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Werror">-Werror</a></dt><dd>

Make all warnings into hard errors.  Source code which triggers warnings
will be rejected.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-Wsystem-headers">-Wsystem-headers</a></dt><dd>

Issue warnings for code in system headers.  These are normally unhelpful
in finding bugs in your own code, therefore suppressed.  If you are
responsible for the system library, you may want to see them.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-w">-w</a></dt><dd>

Suppress all warnings, including those which GNU CPP issues by default.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-pedantic">-pedantic</a></dt><dd>

Issue all the mandatory diagnostics listed in the C standard.  Some of
them are left out by default, since they trigger frequently on harmless
code.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-pedantic-errors">-pedantic-errors</a></dt><dd>

Issue all the mandatory diagnostics, and make all mandatory diagnostics
into errors.  This includes mandatory diagnostics that GCC issues
without <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-pedantic">-pedantic</a></span> but treats as warnings.
  </dd><dt><a id="-M" class="in-doc" href="#-M">-M</a></dt><dd>

Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for <em>make</em> describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one <em>make</em> rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from <span class="option">-include</span> or
<span class="option">-imacros</span> command line options.

<p>Unless specified explicitly (with <span class="option">-MT</span> or <span class="option">-MQ</span>), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using <em>\</em>-newline.  The rule has no
commands.</p>

<p>This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
<span class="option">-dM</span>.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
<span class="option">-MF</span>, or use an environment variable like
<em>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</em>.  Debug output
will still be sent to the regular output stream as normal.</p>

<p>Passing <span class="option">-M</span> to the driver implies <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span>, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-w">-w</a></span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-MM" class="in-doc" href="#-MM">-MM</a></dt><dd>

Like <span class="option">-M</span> but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.

<p>This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
<em>#include</em> directive does not in itself determine whether that
header will appear in <span class="option">-MM</span> dependency output.  This is a
slight change in semantics from GCC versions 3.0 and earlier.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-MF" class="in-doc" href="#-MF">-MF</a> <em><code>file</code></em></dt><dd>

When used with <span class="option">-M</span> or <span class="option">-MM</span>, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no <span class="option">-MF</span> switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would have sent
preprocessed output.

<p>When used with the driver options <span class="option">-MD</span> or <span class="option">-MMD</span>,
<span class="option">-MF</span> overrides the default dependency output file.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-MG" class="in-doc" href="#-MG">-MG</a></dt><dd>

In conjunction with an option such as <span class="option">-M</span> requesting
dependency generation, <span class="option">-MG</span> assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
<em>`#include'</em> directive without prepending any path.  <span class="option">-MG</span>
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.

<p>This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-MP" class="in-doc" href="#-MP">-MP</a></dt><dd>

This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors <em>make</em> gives if you remove header
files without updating the <em>Makefile</em> to match.

<p>This is typical output:</p>

<pre><code>test.o: test.c test.h

test.h:</code></pre> 
  </dd><dt><a id="-MT" class="in-doc" href="#-MT">-MT</a> <em><code>target</code></em></dt><dd>

Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as <span class="markup">.c</span>, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.

<p>An <span class="option">-MT</span> option will set the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to <span class="option">-MT</span>, or use multiple <span class="option">-MT</span> options.</p>

<p>For example, <span class="option">-MT&nbsp;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</span> might give</p>

<pre><code>$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c</code></pre> 
  </dd><dt><a id="-MQ" class="in-doc" href="#-MQ">-MQ</a> <em><code>target</code></em></dt><dd>

<span class="option">-MD</span> is equivalent to <span class="option">-M -MF</span> <em>file</em>, except that
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span> is not implied.  The driver determines <em>file</em> based on
whether an <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a></span> option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of <span class="markup">.d</span>, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a <span class="markup">.d</span> suffix.

<p>If <span class="option">-MD</span> is used in conjunction with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span>, any
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a></span> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span>, each <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-o">-o</a></span>

<p>Since <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span> is not implied, <span class="option">-MD</span> can be used to generate

When using precompiled headers, this flag

This option allows use of a precompiled header together with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span>.  It inserts a special <em>`#pragma'</em>,
<em>`#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "</em><em>filename</em><em>"'</em> in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its <em>filename</em>.
When <span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span> is in use, GCC recognizes this <em>`#pragma'</em>
and loads the PCH.

<p>This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to GCC.  It is switched on by
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-save-temps">-save-temps</a></span>.</p>

<p>You should not write this <em>`#pragma'</em> in your own code, but it is

Specify the source language: C, C++;, Objective-C, or assembly.  This has
nothing to do with standards conformance or extensions; it merely
selects which base syntax to expect.  If you give none of these options,
cpp will deduce the language from the extension of the source file:

When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.

<p>The option's behavior depends on the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span> and <span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span>
options.</p>

<p>With <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as <em>`#define'</em>, <em>`#ifdef'</em>, and <em>`#error'</em>.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the <span class="option">-dD</span> option is
implicitly enabled.</p>

<p>With <span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span>, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as <em>`_ _LINE_ _'</em>, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of

Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with <span class="option">-C</span> to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.

<p><span class="option">-fpreprocessed</span> is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions <span class="markup">.i</span>, <span class="markup">.ii</span> or <span class="markup">.mi</span>.  These are the

Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The <em>level</em> parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value <code class="literal">0</code> of <em>level</em> de-activates
this option just as if no <span class="option">-ftrack-macro-expansion</span> was present
on the command line. Value <code class="literal">1</code> tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value <code class="literal">2</code> tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
<code class="literal">2</code>.

locale does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is UTF-8.  This can be overridden by either the locale

Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of

current working directory followed by two slashes.  GCC will use this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form <span class="option">-fno-working-directory</span>.  If the <span class="option">-P</span> flag is

<em>CHARS</em> is a sequence of one or more of the following characters,

conflicts, the result is undefined.
    <dl class="same-line"><dt><em>M</em></dt><dd>

Instead of the normal output, generate a list of <em>#define</em>
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the

finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file <code class="filename">foo.h</code>, the command

<pre><code>touch foo.h; cpp -dM foo.h</code></pre> 

<p>will show all the predefined macros.</p>

<p>If you use <span class="option">-dM</span> without the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-E">-E</a></span> option, <span class="option">-dM</span> is

Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.

<p>You should be prepared for side effects when using <span class="option">-C</span>; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.

These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.</p>
<dl><dt id="object-file-name"><em>object-file-name</em></dt><dd>

A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.

  <dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-l">-l</a> <em><code>library</code></em></dt><dd>


Search the library named <em>library</em> when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
POSIX compliance and is not recommended.)

<p>It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, <code>foo.o -lz bar.o</code> searches library <em>z</em>
after file <code class="filename">foo.o</code> but before <em>bar.o</em>.  If <em>bar.o</em> refers
to functions in <em>z</em>, those functions may not be loaded.</p>

<p>The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
which is actually a file named <em>liblibrary.a</em>.  The linker
then uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.</p>

<p>The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with <span class="option">-L</span>.</p>

<p>Normally the files found this way are library files---archive files
whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive file by
scanning through it for members which define symbols that have so far
been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that is found is an
ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual fashion.  The only
difference between using an <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-l">-l</a></span> option and specifying a file name
is that <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-l">-l</a></span> surrounds <em>library</em> with <em>lib</em> and <span class="markup">.a</span>
and searches several directories.</p>

or <em>`-shared-libgcc'</em>, are ignored.  
The standard startup files are used normally, unless <span class="option">-nostartfiles</span>

<p>The compiler may generate calls to <em>`memcmp'</em>,

<p>One of the standard libraries bypassed by <span class="option">-nostdlib</span> and

which GCC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special

<p>In most cases, you need <em>libgcc.a</em> even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify <span class="option">-nostdlib</span>

This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal GCC

  <dt><a id="-static-libgcc" class="in-doc" href="#-static-libgcc">-static-libgcc</a></dt><dd>


On systems that provide <em>libgcc</em> as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
If no shared version of <em>libgcc</em> was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.

<p>There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared <em>libgcc</em> instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared <em>libgcc</em>.</p>

<p>Therefore, the G++ and GCJ drivers automatically add
<span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span> whenever you build a shared library or a main
executable, because C++; and Java programs typically use exceptions, so
this is the right thing to do.</p>

<p>If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared <em>libgcc</em>.
If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a GNU linker that does not support option <span class="option">--eh-frame-hdr</span>,
it links the shared version of <em>libgcc</em> into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of <em>libgcc</em>, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.</p>

<p>However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ or GCJ driver, as appropriate
for the languages used in the program, or using the option
<span class="option">-shared-libgcc</span>, such that it is linked with the shared
<em>libgcc</em>.</p>

When the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-fsanitize">-fsanitize</a>=address</span> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <em>libasan</em>.  If
<em>libasan</em> is available as a shared library, and the <span class="option">-static</span>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<em>libasan</em>.  The <span class="option">-static-libasan</span> option directs the GCC

other libraries statically.

When the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-fsanitize">-fsanitize</a>=thread</span> option is used to link a program,
the GCC driver automatically links against <em>libtsan</em>.  If
<em>libtsan</em> is available as a shared library, and the <span class="option">-static</span>
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
<em>libtsan</em>.  The <span class="option">-static-libtsan</span> option directs the GCC
driver to link <em>libtsan</em> statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
  </dd><dt>-static-libstdc++</dt><dd>

When the <em>g++</em> program is used to link a C++; program, it
normally automatically links against <em>libstdc++</em>.  If
<em>libstdc++</em> is available as a shared library, and the
<span class="option">-static</span> option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of <em>libstdc++</em>.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of <em>libstdc++</em> used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
<span class="option">-static-libstdc++</span> option directs the <em>g++</em> driver to
link <em>libstdc++</em> statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.
  </dd><dt><a id="-symbolic" class="in-doc" href="#-symbolic">-symbolic</a></dt><dd>

Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn

this option.
  </dd><dt><a id="-T" class="in-doc" href="#-T">-T</a> <em><code>script</code></em></dt><dd>

Use <em>script</em> as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the GNU linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the <span class="option">-T</span> option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.
  </dd><dt><a id="-Xlinker" class="in-doc" href="#-Xlinker">-Xlinker</a> <em><code>option</code></em></dt><dd>

Pass <em>option</em> as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that GCC does not recognize.

<p>If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
<span class="option">-Xlinker</span> twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass <span class="option">-assert definitions</span>, you must write
<span class="option">-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</span>.  It does not work to write
<span class="option">-Xlinker “-assert definitions”</span>, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.</p>

<p>When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the <em>option</em><em>=</em><em>value</em>
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
<span class="option">-Xlinker -Map=output.map</span> rather than
<span class="option">-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map</span>.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-Wl" class="in-doc" href="#-Wl">-Wl</a>,<em><code>option</code></em></dt><dd>

Pass <em>option</em> as an option to the linker.  If <em>option</em> contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, <span class="option">-Wl,-Map,output.map</span> passes <span class="option">-Map output.map</span> to the
linker.  When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
<span class="option">-Wl,-Map=output.map</span>.

<div class="subsection" id="Options-Options_for_Directory_Search"><a href="#Options-Options_for_Directory_Search"><h3>Options for Directory Search</h3></a>
<p>
These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:</p>
<dl><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a><em><code>dir</code></em></dt><dd>

Add the directory <em>dir</em> to the head of the list of directories to be
searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system header
file, substituting your own version, since these directories are
searched before the system header file directories.  However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files (use <span class="option">-isystem</span> for that).  If you use more than
one <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span> option, the directories are scanned in left-to-right
order; the standard system directories come after.

<p>If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
<span class="option">-isystem</span>, is also specified with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span>, the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span>
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that GCC's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the <em>`include_next'</em> directive are not inadvertently changed.
If you really need to change the search order for system directories,
use the <span class="option">-nostdinc</span> and/or <span class="option">-isystem</span> options.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-iplugindir" class="in-doc" href="#-iplugindir">-iplugindir</a>=<em><code>dir</code></em></dt><dd>

  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-iquote">-iquote</a><em><code>dir</code></em></dt><dd>

  </dd><dt><a id="-B" class="in-doc" href="#-B">-B</a><em><code>prefix</code></em></dt><dd>

This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

<p>The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
<em>cpp</em>, <em>cc1</em>, <em>as</em> and <em>ld</em>.  It tries
<em>prefix</em> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without <em>machine</em><em>/</em><em>version</em><em>/</em>.</p>

<p>For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
<span class="option">-B</span> prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if <span class="option">-B</span>
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, 
<code class="filename">/usr/lib/gcc/</code> and <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib/gcc/</code>.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
<em>PATH</em> environment variable.</p>

<p>The compiler checks to see if the path provided by the <span class="option">-B</span>
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.</p>

<p><span class="option">-B</span> prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into <span class="option">-L</span> options for the linker.  They also apply to
includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into <span class="option">-isystem</span> options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends <em>include</em> to the prefix.</p>

<p>The runtime support file <code class="filename">libgcc.a</code> can also be searched for using
the <span class="option">-B</span> prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.</p>

<p>Another way to specify a prefix much like the <span class="option">-B</span> prefix is to use
the environment variable <em>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</em>.</p>

<p>As a special kludge, if the path provided by <span class="option">-B</span> is
<em>[dir/]stageN/</em>, where <em>N</em> is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by <em>[dir/]include</em>.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-specs" class="in-doc" href="#-specs">-specs</a>=<em><code>file</code></em></dt><dd>

Process <em>file</em> after the compiler reads in the standard <em>specs</em>
file, in order to override the defaults which the <code>gcc</code> driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to <em>cc1</em>,
<em>cc1plus</em>, <em>as</em>, <em>ld</em>, etc.  More than one
<span class="option">-specs=</span><em><code>file</code></em> can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
  </dd><dt><a id="--sysroot" class="in-doc" href="#--sysroot">--sysroot</a>=<em><code>dir</code></em></dt><dd>

Use <em>dir</em> as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
<code class="filename">/usr/include</code> and libraries in <code class="filename">/usr/lib</code>, it instead
searches <em>dir/usr/include</em> and <em>dir/usr/lib</em>.

<p>If you use both this option and the <span class="option">-isysroot</span> option, then
the <span class="option">--sysroot</span> option applies to libraries, but the
<span class="option">-isysroot</span> option applies to header files.</p>

<p>The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of <span class="option">--sysroot</span> still works, but the
library aspect does not.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="--no-sysroot-suffix" class="in-doc" href="#--no-sysroot-suffix">--no-sysroot-suffix</a></dt><dd>

For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with <span class="option">--sysroot</span>, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
<em>dir/suffix/usr/include</em> instead of
<em>dir/usr/include</em>.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></dt><dd>

This option has been deprecated.  Please use <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-iquote">-iquote</a></span> instead for
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span> directories before the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></span> and remove the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></span>.
Any directories you specify with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span> options before the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></span>
option are searched only for the case of <em>#include "</em><em>file</em><em>"</em>;
they are not searched for <em>#include &lt;</em><em>file</em><em>&gt;</em>.

<p>If additional directories are specified with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span> options after
the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></span>, these directories are searched for all <em>#include</em>
directives.  (Ordinarily <em>all</em> <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span> directories are used
this way.)</p>

<p>In addition, the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></span> option inhibits the use of the current
directory (where the current input file came from) as the first search
directory for <em>#include "</em><em>file</em><em>"</em>.  There is no way to
override this effect of <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></span>.  With <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a>.</span> you can specify
searching the directory that is current when the compiler is
invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor does
by default, but it is often satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></span> does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
for header files.  Thus, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I-">-I-</a></span> and <span class="option">-nostdinc</span> are
independent.</p>

<p>Feature modifiers used with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span> and <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a></span> can be one
the following:</p>
  </dd><dt id="crypto"><em>crypto</em></dt><dd>

Enable Crypto extension.  This implies Advanced SIMD is enabled.
  </dd><dt id="fp"><em>fp</em></dt><dd>

Enable floating-point instructions.

<p><em>Adapteva Epiphany Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-mhalf-reg-file" class="in-doc" href="#-mhalf-reg-file">-mhalf-reg-file</a></dt><dd>

Don't allocate any register in the range <em>`r32'</em>...<em>`r63'</em>.
That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these registers.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mprefer-short-insn-regs" class="in-doc" href="#-mprefer-short-insn-regs">-mprefer-short-insn-regs</a></dt><dd>

Preferrentially allocate registers that allow short instruction generation.
This can result in increased instruction count, so this may either reduce or
increase overall code size.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mbranch-cost" class="in-doc" href="#-mbranch-cost">-mbranch-cost</a>=<em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the cost of branches to roughly <em>num</em> “simple” instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mcmove" class="in-doc" href="#-mcmove">-mcmove</a></dt><dd>

Enable the generation of conditional moves.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mnops" class="in-doc" href="#-mnops">-mnops</a>=<em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

Emit <em>num</em> NOPs before every other generated instruction.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mno-soft-cmpsf" class="in-doc" href="#-mno-soft-cmpsf">-mno-soft-cmpsf</a></dt><dd>

For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an <em>`fsub'</em> instruction
and test the flags.  This is faster than a software comparison, but can
get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs, or when two different small
numbers are compared such that their difference is calculated as zero.
The default is <span class="option">-msoft-cmpsf</span>, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant,
software comparisons.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mstack-offset" class="in-doc" href="#-mstack-offset">-mstack-offset</a>=<em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer.
E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range <em>`sp+0...sp+7'</em>
can be used by leaf functions without stack allocation.
Values other than <code class="literal">8</code> or <code class="literal">16</code> are untested and unlikely to work.
Note also that this option changes the ABI; compiling a program with a
different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
generally does not work.
This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack
offset would give you better code, but to actually use a different stack
offset to build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate <span class="option">--with-stack-offset=</span><em><code>num</code></em> option.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mno-round-nearest" class="in-doc" href="#-mno-round-nearest">-mno-round-nearest</a></dt><dd>

Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
truncating.  The default is <span class="option">-mround-nearest</span>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mlong-calls" class="in-doc" href="#-mlong-calls">-mlong-calls</a></dt><dd>

If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be beyond
the offset range of the <em>`b'</em> / <em>`bl'</em> instructions, and therefore load the
function address into a register before performing a (otherwise direct) call.
This is the default.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mshort-calls" class="in-doc" href="#-mshort-calls">-mshort-calls</a></dt><dd>

If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are
in the range of the <em>`b'</em> / <em>`bl'</em> instructions, so use these instructions
for direct calls.  The default is <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mlong-calls">-mlong-calls</a></span>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-msmall16" class="in-doc" href="#-msmall16">-msmall16</a></dt><dd>

Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values.  This does not
apply to function addresses for which <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mlong-calls">-mlong-calls</a></span> semantics
are in effect.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mfp-mode" class="in-doc" href="#-mfp-mode">-mfp-mode</a>=<em><code>mode</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.
This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected
at function call and return time.  Making this mode match the mode you
predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller and
faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.

<p><em>mode</em> can be set to one the following values:</p>
    <dl><dt><em>caller</em></dt><dd>

Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when
the function returns, and when it calls other functions.
This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other compilation units
you might want to incorporate into different programs with different
prevailing FPU modes, and the convenience of being able to use a single
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any extra
mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed
with a more specific choice of prevailing FPU mode.
      </dd><dt><em>truncate</em></dt><dd>

This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.  That includes
conversion from floating point to integer.
      </dd><dt><em>round-nearest</em></dt><dd>

This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.
      </dd><dt><em>int</em></dt><dd>

This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the FPU, e.g.
integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.
      </dd></dl>
  

<p>The default is <span class="option">-mfp-mode=caller</span>

  <dt><a id="-mno-postmodify" class="in-doc" href="#-mno-postmodify">-mno-postmodify</a></dt><dd>


Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting of 32-bit
loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and generation of
post-modify addresses.  The defaults are <em>msplit-lohi</em>,
<span class="option">-mpost-inc</span>, and <span class="option">-mpost-modify</span>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mnovect-double" class="in-doc" href="#-mnovect-double">-mnovect-double</a></dt><dd>

Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode.  The default is
<span class="option">-mvect-double</span>, which uses DImode as preferred SIMD mode.
  </dd><dt><a id="-max-vect-align" class="in-doc" href="#-max-vect-align">-max-vect-align</a>=<em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

The maximum alignment for SIMD vector mode types.
<em>num</em> may be 4 or 8.  The default is 8.
Note that this is an ABI change, even though many library function
interfaces are unaffected if they don't use SIMD vector modes
in places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant types.
  </dd><dt><a id="-msplit-vecmove-early" class="in-doc" href="#-msplit-vecmove-early">-msplit-vecmove-early</a></dt><dd>

Split vector moves into single word moves before reload.  In theory this
can give better register allocation, but so far the reverse seems to be
generally the case.
  </dd><dt><a id="-m1reg-" class="in-doc" href="#-m1reg-">-m1reg-</a><em><code>reg</code></em></dt><dd>

Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes loading small negative
constants and certain bitmasks faster.
Allowable values for <em>reg</em> are <em>r43</em> and <em>r63</em>,
which specify use of that register as a fixed register,
and <em>none</em>, which means that no register is used for this
purpose.  The default is <span class="option">-m1reg-none</span>.

<p><em>ARM Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
architectures:</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-mabi" class="in-doc" href="#-mabi">-mabi</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Generate code for the specified ABI.  Permissible values are: <em>apcs-gnu</em>,
<em>atpcs</em>, <em>aapcs</em>, <em>aapcs-linux</em> and <em>iwmmxt</em>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mapcs-frame" class="in-doc" href="#-mapcs-frame">-mapcs-frame</a></dt><dd>

Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying <span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span>
with this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is <span class="option">-mno-apcs-frame</span>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mapcs" class="in-doc" href="#-mapcs">-mapcs</a></dt><dd>

This is a synonym for <span class="option">-mapcs-frame</span>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mthumb-interwork" class="in-doc" href="#-mthumb-interwork">-mthumb-interwork</a></dt><dd>

Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre-v5 architectures, the
two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The
default is <span class="option">-mno-thumb-interwork</span>, since slightly larger code
is generated when <span class="option">-mthumb-interwork</span> is specified.  In AAPCS
configurations this option is meaningless.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mno-sched-prolog" class="in-doc" href="#-mno-sched-prolog">-mno-sched-prolog</a></dt><dd>

Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is <span class="option">-msched-prolog</span>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mfloat-abi" class="in-doc" href="#-mfloat-abi">-mfloat-abi</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Specifies which floating-point ABI to use.  Permissible values
are: <em>soft</em>, <em>softfp</em> and <em>hard</em>.

<p>Specifying <em>soft</em> causes GCC to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations.
<em>softfp</em> allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.
<em>hard</em> allows generation of floating-point instructions
and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.</p>

<p>The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a
compatible set of libraries.</p>
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mlittle-endian">-mlittle-endian</a></dt><dd>

Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mbig-endian">-mbig-endian</a></dt><dd>

Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mwords-little-endian" class="in-doc" href="#-mwords-little-endian">-mwords-little-endian</a></dt><dd>

This option only applies when generating code for big-endian processors.
Generate code for a little-endian word order but a big-endian byte
order.  That is, a byte order of the form <code class="literal">32107654</code>.  Note: this
option should only be used if you require compatibility with code for
big-endian ARM processors generated by versions of the compiler prior to
2.8.  This option is now deprecated.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture.  GCC uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=</span> option.  Permissible names are: <em>armv2</em>,
<em>armv2a</em>, <em>armv3</em>, <em>armv3m</em>, <em>armv4</em>, <em>armv4t</em>,
<em>armv5</em>, <em>armv5t</em>, <em>armv5e</em>, <em>armv5te</em>,

<p><span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a>=generic-</span><em><code>arch</code></em> specifies that GCC should tune the
performance for a blend of processors within architecture <em>arch</em>.
The aim is to generate code that run well on the current most popular
processors, balancing between optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the
range, and avoiding performance pitfalls of other CPUs.  The effects of
this option may change in future GCC versions as CPU models come and go.</p>

<p><span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a>=native</span> causes the compiler to auto-detect the CPU

unsuccessful the option has no effect.</p>
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

This specifies the name of the target ARM processor.  GCC uses this name
to derive the name of the target ARM architecture (as if specified
by <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span>) and the ARM processor type for which to tune for
performance (as if specified by <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a></span>).  Where this option
is used in conjunction with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span> or <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a></span>,
those options take precedence over the appropriate part of this option.

<p>Permissible names for this option are the same as those for

<p><span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=generic-</span><em><code>arch</code></em> is also permissible, and is

unsuccessful the option has no effect.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-mfpu" class="in-doc" href="#-mfpu">-mfpu</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: <em>vfp</em>, <em>vfpv3</em>,
<em>vfpv3-fp16</em>, <em>vfpv3-d16</em>, <em>vfpv3-d16-fp16</em>, <em>vfpv3xd</em>,

<em>fp-armv8</em>, <em>neon-fp-armv8</em>, and <em>crypto-neon-fp-armv8</em>.

<p>If <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> is specified this specifies the format of
floating-point values.</p>

<p>If the selected floating-point hardware includes the NEON extension
(e.g. <span class="option">-mfpu</span>=<em>neon</em>), note that floating-point
operations are not generated by GCC's auto-vectorization pass unless
<span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span> is also specified.  This is
because NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE 754 standard for
floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
zero), so the use of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of precision.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-mfp16-format" class="in-doc" href="#-mfp16-format">-mfp16-format</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Specify the format of the <em>`_ _fp16'</em> half-precision floating-point type.
Permissible names are <em>none</em>, <em>ieee</em>, and <em>alternative</em>;
the default is <em>none</em>, in which case the <em>`_ _fp16'</em> type is not
defined.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mstructure-size-boundary" class="in-doc" href="#-mstructure-size-boundary">-mstructure-size-boundary</a>=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>

The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the COFF
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying ABI supports it.

<p>Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-mabort-on-noreturn" class="in-doc" href="#-mabort-on-noreturn">-mabort-on-noreturn</a></dt><dd>

Generate a call to the function <em>`abort'</em> at the end of a

  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mlong-calls">-mlong-calls</a></dt>


  <dt><a id="-mno-long-calls" class="in-doc" href="#-mno-long-calls">-mno-long-calls</a></dt><dd>


Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 64-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.

<p>Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
that have the <em>short-call</em> attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a <em>#pragma no_long_calls</em> directive, and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this rule are
that weak function definitions, functions with the <em>long-call</em>
attribute or the <var>section</var> attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a <em>#pragma long_calls</em> directive are always
turned into long calls.</p>

<p>This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
<span class="option">-mno-long-calls</span> restores the default behavior, as does
placing the function calls within the scope of a <em>#pragma
long_calls_off</em> directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-msingle-pic-base" class="in-doc" href="#-msingle-pic-base">-msingle-pic-base</a></dt><dd>

Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than
loading it in the prologue for each function.  The runtime system is
responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
before execution begins.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mpic-register" class="in-doc" href="#-mpic-register">-mpic-register</a>=<em><code>reg</code></em></dt><dd>

Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing.
For standard PIC base case, the default will be any suitable register
determined by compiler.  For single PIC base case, the default is
<em>R9</em> if target is EABI based or stack-checking is enabled,
otherwise the default is <em>R10</em>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-mpoke-function-name" class="in-doc" href="#-mpoke-function-name">-mpoke-function-name</a></dt><dd>

Write the name of each function into the text section, directly
preceding the function prologue.  The generated code is similar to this:

<pre><code>t0
    .ascii "arm_poke_function_name", 0
    .align
t1
    .word 0xff000000 + (t1 - t0)
arm_poke_function_name
    mov     ip, sp
    stmfd   sp!, {fp, ip, lr, pc}
    sub     fp, ip, #4</code></pre> 
<p>When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of
<em>`pc'</em> stored at <em>`fp + 0'</em>.  If the trace function then looks at
location <em>`pc - 12'</em> and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location
and has length <em>`((pc[-3]) &amp; 0xff000000)'</em>.</p>

Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an ARM
instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
rest of the function.  This allows these functions to be called from
non-interworking code.  This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations
because interworking is enabled by default.

Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been
compiled for interworking or not.  There is a small overhead in the cost
of executing a function pointer if this option is enabled.  This option
is not valid in AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled
by default.

Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer.  The valid
models are <em>soft</em>, which generates calls to <em>`_ _aeabi_read_tp'</em>,
<em>cp15</em>, which fetches the thread pointer from <em>`cp15'</em> directly
(supported in the arm6k architecture), and <em>auto</em>, which uses the
best available method for the selected processor.  The default setting is
<em>auto</em>.
  </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtls-dialect">-mtls-dialect</a>=<em><code>dialect</code></em></dt><dd>

Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage.  Two
<em>dialect</em>s are supported---<em>gnu</em> and <em>gnu2</em>.  The
<em>gnu</em> dialect selects the original GNU scheme for supporting
local and global dynamic TLS models.  The <em>gnu2</em> dialect
selects the GNU descriptor scheme, which provides better performance
for shared libraries.  The GNU descriptor scheme is compatible with
the original scheme, but does require new assembler, linker and
library support.  Initial and local exec TLS models are unaffected by
this option and always use the original scheme.

Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when <em>`ldrd'</em> instructions

Cortex-A9 MPCore processors have an erratum that very rarely causes
successive reads from a memory locations to appear out of program order
if another processor is simultaneously writing to the same location.
This causes problems if volatile variables are used for communication
between processors: the workaround enabled by this option, as recommended
by ARM, is to insert a <em>`dmb'</em> instruction after each volatile load.
Because of the potentially high overhead of the workaround, it is never
enabled by default.

<p><em>`EIND'</em> and Devices with more than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash
</p>

<p>Pointers in the implementation are 16@tie{}bits wide.
The address of a function or label is represented as word address so
that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the
range of 64@tie{}Ki words.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128@tie{}Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called
<em>`EIND'</em> that serves as most significant part of the target address
when <em>`EICALL'</em> or <em>`EIJMP'</em> instructions are used.</p>

<p>Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by
the compiler and are subject to some limitations:</p>
  <ul><li>
<p>The compiler never sets <em>`EIND'</em>.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>The compiler uses <em>`EIND'</em> implicitely in <em>`EICALL'</em>/<em>`EIJMP'</em>
instructions or might read <em>`EIND'</em> directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a <em>`RET'</em> instruction.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>The compiler assumes that <em>`EIND'</em> never changes during the startup
code or during the application. In particular, <em>`EIND'</em> is not
saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
prologue/epilogue.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
generates <em>stubs</em>. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
<em>trampolines</em>. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.
The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker will generate
the stubs correctly an all situaltion. See the compiler option
<em>`-mrelax'</em> and the linler option <em>`--relax'</em>.
There are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate stubs
but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful error message.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>The default linker script is arranged for code with <em>`EIND = 0'</em>.
If code is supposed to work for a setup with <em>`EIND != 0'</em>, a custom
linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
name start with <em>`.trampolines'</em> into the segment where <em>`EIND'</em>
points to.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>The startup code from libgcc never sets <em>`EIND'</em>.
Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC.
For the impact of AVR-LibC on <em>`EIND'</em>, see the
AVR-LibC&nbsp;user&nbsp;manual (<em>`<a href="http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/">nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/</a>'</em>).</p>
    </li><li>
<p>It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up <em>`EIND'</em>
early, for example by means of initialization code located in
section <em>`.init3'</em>. Such code runs prior to general startup code
that initializes RAM and calls constructors, but after the bit
of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets <em>`EIND'</em> to the segment
where the vector table is located.</p>

<pre><code>int <span class="func-name">main</span>(<var>void</var>);<br><br>
        {<br><br><br>
            /* Call function at word address 0x2 */<br>
<br><br>
            return ((int(*)(void)) 0x2)();<br>
        }</code></pre> 
<p>Instead, a stub has to be set up, i.e. the function has to be called
through a symbol (<em>`func_4'</em> in the example):</p>

<pre><code>int <span class="func-name">main</span>(<var>void</var>);<br><br>
        {<br><br><br>
            extern int func_4 (void);<br>
        <br>
            /* Call function at byte address 0x4 */<br>
<br>return <span class="func-name">func_4</span>();<br><br><br>
        }<br></code></pre> 
<p>and the application be linked with <em>`-Wl,--defsym,func_4=0x4'</em>.
Alternatively, <em>`func_4'</em> can be defined in the linker script.</p>

<p>Handling of the <em>`RAMPD'</em>, <em>`RAMPX'</em>, <em>`RAMPY'</em> and <em>`RAMPZ'</em> Special Function Registers
</p>

<p>Some AVR devices support memories larger than the 64@tie{}KiB range
that can be accessed with 16-bit pointers.  To access memory locations
outside this 64@tie{}KiB range, the contentent of a <em>`RAMP'</em>
register is used as high part of the address:
The <em>`X'</em>, <em>`Y'</em>, <em>`Z'</em> address register is concatenated
with the <em>`RAMPX'</em>, <em>`RAMPY'</em>, <em>`RAMPZ'</em> special function
register, respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,
<em>`RAMPD'</em> is used together with direct addressing.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>The startup code initializes the <em>`RAMP'</em> special function
registers with zero.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>If a <em>AVR Named Address Spaces,named address space</em> other than
generic or <em>`_ _flash'</em> is used, then <em>`RAMPZ'</em> is set
as needed before the operation.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>If the device supports RAM larger than 64@tie{KiB} and the compiler
needs to change <em>`RAMPZ'</em> to accomplish an operation, <em>`RAMPZ'</em>
is reset to zero after the operation.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>If the device comes with a specific <em>`RAMP'</em> register, the ISR
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that SFR and initializes it with
zero in case the ISR code might (implicitly) use it.</p>
    </li><li>
<p>RAM larger than 64@tie{KiB} is not supported by GCC for AVR targets.
If you use inline assembler to read from locations outside the
16-bit address range and change one of the <em>`RAMP'</em> registers,
you must reset it to zero after the access.</p>

<p>AVR Built-in Macros
</p>

<p>GCC defines several built-in macros so that the user code can test
for the presence or absence of features.  Almost any of the following
built-in macros are deduced from device capabilities and thus
triggered by the <em>`-mmcu='</em> command-line option.</p>

<p>For even more AVR-specific built-in macros see
<em>AVR Named Address Spaces</em> and <em>AVR Built-in Functions</em>.</p>

<p>
Build-in macro that resolves to a decimal number that identifies the
architecture and depends on the <em>`-mmcu=</em><em>mcu</em><em>'</em> option.
Possible values are:</p>

<p><em>2</em>, <em>25</em>, <em>3</em>, <em>31</em>, <em>35</em>,
<em>4</em>, <em>5</em>, <em>51</em>, <em>6</em>, <em>102</em>, <em>104</em>,
<em>105</em>, <em>106</em>, <em>107</em></p>

<p>for <em>mcu</em>=<em>`avr2'</em>, <em>`avr25'</em>, <em>`avr3'</em>,
<em>`avr31'</em>, <em>`avr35'</em>, <em>`avr4'</em>, <em>`avr5'</em>, <em>`avr51'</em>,
<em>`avr6'</em>, <em>`avrxmega2'</em>, <em>`avrxmega4'</em>, <em>`avrxmega5'</em>,
<em>`avrxmega6'</em>, <em>`avrxmega7'</em>, respectively.
If <em>mcu</em> specifies a device, this built-in macro is set
accordingly. For example, with <em>`-mmcu=atmega8'</em> the macro will be
defined to <em>4</em>.</p>

<p>
Setting <em>`-mmcu=</em><em>device</em><em>'</em> defines this built-in macro which reflects
the device's name. For example, <em>`-mmcu=atmega8'</em> defines the
built-in macro <em>`_ _AVR_ATmega8_ _'</em>, <em>`-mmcu=attiny261a'</em> defines
<em>`_ _AVR_ATtiny261A_ _'</em>, etc.</p>

<p>The built-in macros' names follow
the scheme <em>`_ _AVR_</em><em>Device</em><em>_ _'</em> where <em>Device</em> is
the device name as from the AVR user manual. The difference between
<em>Device</em> in the built-in macro and <em>device</em> in
<em>`-mmcu=</em><em>device</em><em>'</em> is that the latter is always lowercase.</p>

<p>If <em>device</em> is not a device but only a core architecture like
<em>`avr51'</em>, this macro will not be defined.</p>

<p>
The device / architecture belongs to the XMEGA family of devices.</p>

<p>
The device has the the <em>`ELPM'</em> instruction.</p>

<p>
The device has the <em>`ELPM R</em><em>n</em><em>,Z'</em> and <em>`ELPM
R</em><em>n</em><em>,Z+'</em> instructions.</p>

<p>
The device has the <em>`MOVW'</em> instruction to perform 16-bit
register-register moves.</p>

<p>
The device has the <em>`LPM R</em><em>n</em><em>,Z'</em> and
<em>`LPM R</em><em>n</em><em>,Z+'</em> instructions.</p>

<p>
The device has a hardware multiplier.</p>

<p>
The device has the <em>`JMP'</em> and <em>`CALL'</em> instructions.
This is the case for devices with at least 16@tie{}KiB of program
memory.</p>




<p>

The device has the <em>`EIJMP'</em> and <em>`EICALL'</em> instructions.
This is the case for devices with more than 128@tie{}KiB of program memory.
This also means that the program counter
(PC) is 3@tie{}bytes wide.</p>

<p>
The program counter (PC) is 2@tie{}bytes wide. This is the case for devices
with up to 128@tie{}KiB of program memory.</p>




<p>

The stack pointer (SP) register is treated as 8-bit respectively
16-bit register by the compiler.
The definition of these macros is affected by <em>`-mtiny-stack'</em>.</p>




<p>

The device has the SPH (high part of stack pointer) special function
register or has an 8-bit stack pointer, respectively.
The definition of these macros is affected by <em>`-mmcu='</em> and
in the cases of <em>`-mmcu=avr2'</em> and <em>`-mmcu=avr25'</em> also
by <em>`-msp8'</em>.</p>








<p>

The device has the <em>`RAMPD'</em>, <em>`RAMPX'</em>, <em>`RAMPY'</em>,
<em>`RAMPZ'</em> special function register, respectively.</p>

<p>
This macro reflects the <em>`-mno-interrupts'</em> command line option.</p>




<p>

Some AVR devices (AT90S8515, ATmega103) must not skip 32-bit
instructions because of a hardware erratum.  Skip instructions are
<em>`SBRS'</em>, <em>`SBRC'</em>, <em>`SBIS'</em>, <em>`SBIC'</em> and <em>`CPSE'</em>.
The second macro is only defined if <em>`_ _AVR_HAVE_JMP_CALL_ _'</em> is also
set.</p>

<p>
Instructions that can address I/O special function registers directly
like <em>`IN'</em>, <em>`OUT'</em>, <em>`SBI'</em>, etc. may use a different
address as if addressed by an instruction to access RAM like <em>`LD'</em>
or <em>`STS'</em>. This offset depends on the device architecture and has
to be subtracted from the RAM address in order to get the
respective I/O@tie{}address.</p>

<p>
The compiler is configured to be used together with AVR-Libc.
See the <em>`--with-avrlibc'</em> configure option.</p>

<p><em>Blackfin Options</em>
</p>
    <dl><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=<em><code>cpu</code></em>[<em>-</em><em>sirevision</em>]</dt><dd>

Specifies the name of the target Blackfin processor.  Currently, <em>cpu</em>
can be one of <em>bf512</em>, <em>bf514</em>, <em>bf516</em>, <em>bf518</em>,
<em>bf522</em>, <em>bf523</em>, <em>bf524</em>, <em>bf525</em>, <em>bf526</em>,
<em>bf527</em>, <em>bf531</em>, <em>bf532</em>, <em>bf533</em>,
<em>bf534</em>, <em>bf536</em>, <em>bf537</em>, <em>bf538</em>, <em>bf539</em>,
<em>bf542</em>, <em>bf544</em>, <em>bf547</em>, <em>bf548</em>, <em>bf549</em>,
<em>bf542m</em>, <em>bf544m</em>, <em>bf547m</em>, <em>bf548m</em>, <em>bf549m</em>,
<em>bf561</em>, <em>bf592</em>.

<p>The optional <em>sirevision</em> specifies the silicon revision of the target
Blackfin processor.  Any workarounds available for the targeted silicon revision
are enabled.  If <em>sirevision</em> is <em>none</em>, no workarounds are enabled.
If <em>sirevision</em> is <em>any</em>, all workarounds for the targeted processor
are enabled.  The <em>`_ _SILICON_REVISION_ _'</em> macro is defined to two
hexadecimal digits representing the major and minor numbers in the silicon
revision.  If <em>sirevision</em> is <em>none</em>, the <em>`_ _SILICON_REVISION_ _'</em>
is not defined.  If <em>sirevision</em> is <em>any</em>, the
<em>`_ _SILICON_REVISION_ _'</em> is defined to be <em>0xffff</em>.
If this optional <em>sirevision</em> is not used, GCC assumes the latest known
silicon revision of the targeted Blackfin processor.</p>

<p>GCC defines a preprocessor macro for the specified <em>cpu</em>.
For the <em>bfin-elf</em> toolchain, this option causes the hardware BSP
provided by libgloss to be linked in if <span class="option">-msim</span> is not given.</p>

<p>Without this option, <em>bf532</em> is used as the processor by default.</p>

<p>Note that support for <em>bf561</em> is incomplete.  For <em>bf561</em>,
only the preprocessor macro is defined.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msim</dt><dd>

Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes
the simulator BSP provided by libgloss to be linked in.  This option
has effect only for <em>bfin-elf</em> toolchain.
Certain other options, such as <span class="option">-mid-shared-library</span> and
<span class="option">-mfdpic</span>, imply <span class="option">-msim</span>.
      </dd><dt>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</dt><dd>

Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This
avoids the instructions to save, set up and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.  The option
<span class="option">-fomit-frame-pointer</span> removes the frame pointer for all functions,
which might make debugging harder.
      </dd><dt>-mspecld-anomaly</dt><dd>

When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not
contain speculative loads after jump instructions. If this option is used,
<em>`_ _WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_LOADS'</em> is defined.
      </dd><dt>-mno-specld-anomaly</dt><dd>

Don't generate extra code to prevent speculative loads from occurring.
      </dd><dt>-mcsync-anomaly</dt><dd>

When enabled, the compiler ensures that the generated code does not
contain CSYNC or SSYNC instructions too soon after conditional branches.
If this option is used, <em>`_ _WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_SYNCS'</em> is defined.
      </dd><dt>-mno-csync-anomaly</dt><dd>

Don't generate extra code to prevent CSYNC or SSYNC instructions from
occurring too soon after a conditional branch.
      </dd><dt>-mlow-64k</dt><dd>

When enabled, the compiler is free to take advantage of the knowledge that
the entire program fits into the low 64k of memory.
      </dd><dt>-mno-low-64k</dt><dd>

Assume that the program is arbitrarily large.  This is the default.
      </dd><dt>-mstack-check-l1</dt><dd>

Do stack checking using information placed into L1 scratchpad memory by the
uClinux kernel.
      </dd><dt>-mid-shared-library</dt><dd>

Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method.
This allows for execute in place and shared libraries in an environment
without virtual memory management.  This option implies <span class="option">-fPIC</span>.
With a <em>bfin-elf</em> target, this option implies <span class="option">-msim</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mno-id-shared-library</dt><dd>

Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are being used.
This is the default.
      </dd><dt>-mleaf-id-shared-library</dt><dd>

Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method,
but assumes that this library or executable won't link against any other
ID shared libraries.  That allows the compiler to use faster code for jumps
and calls.
      </dd><dt>-mno-leaf-id-shared-library</dt><dd>

Do not assume that the code being compiled won't link against any ID shared
libraries.  Slower code is generated for jump and call insns.
      </dd><dt>-mshared-library-id=n</dt><dd>

Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying
other values forces the allocation of that number to the current
library but is no more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.
      </dd><dt>-msep-data</dt><dd>

Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute in place in
an environment without virtual memory management by eliminating relocations
against the text section.
      </dd><dt>-mno-sep-data</dt><dd>

Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.
This is the default.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mlong-calls">-mlong-calls</a></dt>


      <dt>-mno-long-calls</dt><dd>


Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 24-bit addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.

<p>This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
<span class="option">-mno-long-calls</span> restores the default behavior.  Note these
switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle
function calls via function pointers.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mfast-fp</dt><dd>

Link with the fast floating-point library. This library relaxes some of
the IEEE floating-point standard's rules for checking inputs against
Not-a-Number (NAN), in the interest of performance.
      </dd><dt>-minline-plt</dt><dd>

Enable inlining of PLT entries in function calls to functions that are
not known to bind locally.  It has no effect without <span class="option">-mfdpic</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mmulticore</dt><dd>

Build a standalone application for multicore Blackfin processors. 
This option causes proper start files and link scripts supporting 
multicore to be used, and defines the macro <em>`_ _BFIN_MULTICORE'</em>. 
It can only be used with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=bf561</span>[<em>-</em><em>sirevision</em>].

<p>This option can be used with <span class="option">-mcorea</span> or <span class="option">-mcoreb</span>, which
selects the one-application-per-core programming model.  Without
<span class="option">-mcorea</span> or <span class="option">-mcoreb</span>, the single-application/dual-core
programming model is used. In this model, the main function of Core B
should be named as <em>`coreb_main'</em>.</p>

<p>If this option is not used, the single-core application programming
model is used.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mcorea</dt><dd>

Build a standalone application for Core A of BF561 when using
the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper start files
and link scripts are used to support Core A, and the macro
<em>`_ _BFIN_COREA'</em> is defined.
This option can only be used in conjunction with <span class="option">-mmulticore</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mcoreb</dt><dd>

Build a standalone application for Core B of BF561 when using
the one-application-per-core programming model. Proper start files
and link scripts are used to support Core B, and the macro
<em>`_ _BFIN_COREB'</em> is defined. When this option is used, <em>`coreb_main'</em>
should be used instead of <em>`main'</em>. 
This option can only be used in conjunction with <span class="option">-mmulticore</span>.
      </dd><dt>-msdram</dt><dd>

Build a standalone application for SDRAM. Proper start files and
link scripts are used to put the application into SDRAM, and the macro
<em>`_ _BFIN_SDRAM'</em> is defined.
The loader should initialize SDRAM before loading the application.
      </dd><dt>-micplb</dt><dd>

Assume that ICPLBs are enabled at run time.  This has an effect on certain
anomaly workarounds.  For Linux targets, the default is to assume ICPLBs
are enabled; for standalone applications the default is off.

<p><em>C6X Options</em>
</p>
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

This specifies the name of the target architecture.  GCC uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  Permissible names are: <em>c62x</em>,
<em>c64x</em>, <em>c64x+</em>, <em>c67x</em>, <em>c67x+</em>, <em>c674x</em>.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mbig-endian">-mbig-endian</a></dt><dd>

Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the simulator.
      </dd><dt>-msdata=default</dt><dd>

Put small global and static data in the <span class="markup">.neardata</span> section,
which is pointed to by register <em>`B14'</em>.  Put small uninitialized
global and static data in the <span class="markup">.bss</span> section, which is adjacent
to the <span class="markup">.neardata</span> section.  Put small read-only data into the
<span class="markup">.rodata</span> section.  The corresponding sections used for large
pieces of data are <span class="markup">.fardata</span>, <span class="markup">.far</span> and <span class="markup">.const</span>.
      </dd><dt>-msdata=all</dt><dd>

Put all data, not just small objects, into the sections reserved for
small data, and use addressing relative to the <em>`B14'</em> register to
access them.
      </dd><dt>-msdata=none</dt><dd>

Make no use of the sections reserved for small data, and use absolute
addresses to access all data.  Put all initialized global and static
data in the <span class="markup">.fardata</span> section, and all uninitialized data in the
<span class="markup">.far</span> section.  Put all constant data into the <span class="markup">.const</span>
section.

<p><em>CRIS Options</em>

      </dd><dt>-mmul-bug-workaround</dt>


      <dt>-mno-mul-bug-workaround</dt><dd>


Work around a bug in the <em>`muls'</em> and <em>`mulu'</em> instructions for CPU
models where it applies.  This option is active by default.
      </dd><dt>-mpdebug</dt><dd>

Enable CRIS-specific verbose debug-related information in the assembly
code.  This option also has the effect of turning off the <em>#NO_APP</em>
formatted-code indicator to the assembler at the beginning of the
assembly file.
      </dd><dt>-mcc-init</dt><dd>

Do not use condition-code results from previous instruction; always emit
compare and test instructions before use of condition codes.
      </dd><dt>-mno-side-effects</dt><dd>

Do not emit instructions with side effects in addressing modes other than
post-increment.
      </dd><dt>-mstack-align</dt>

      <dt>-mno-data-align</dt>

      <dt>-mconst-align</dt>

      <dt>-mno-const-align</dt><dd>


These options (<em>no-</em> options) arrange (eliminate arrangements) for the
stack frame, individual data and constants to be aligned for the maximum
single data access size for the chosen CPU model.  The default is to
arrange for 32-bit alignment.  ABI details such as structure layout are
not affected by these options.
      </dd><dt>-m32-bit</dt>


      <dt>-m16-bit</dt>

      <dt>-m8-bit</dt><dd>


Similar to the stack- data- and const-align options above, these options
arrange for stack frame, writable data and constants to all be 32-bit,
16-bit or 8-bit aligned.  The default is 32-bit alignment.
      </dd><dt>-mno-prologue-epilogue</dt>


      <dt>-mprologue-epilogue</dt><dd>


With <span class="option">-mno-prologue-epilogue</span>, the normal function prologue and
epilogue which set up the stack frame are omitted and no return
instructions or return sequences are generated in the code.  Use this
option only together with visual inspection of the compiled code: no
warnings or errors are generated when call-saved registers must be saved,
or storage for local variables needs to be allocated.
      </dd><dt>-mno-gotplt</dt>


      <dt>-mgotplt</dt><dd>


With <span class="option">-fpic</span> and <span class="option">-fPIC</span>, don't generate (do generate)
instruction sequences that load addresses for functions from the PLT part
of the GOT rather than (traditional on other architectures) calls to the
PLT.  The default is <span class="option">-mgotplt</span>.
      </dd><dt>-melf</dt><dd>

Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-elf and
cris-axis-linux-gnu targets.

Legacy no-op option only recognized with the cris-axis-linux-gnu target.
      </dd><dt>-sim</dt><dd>

This option, recognized for the cris-axis-elf, arranges
to link with input-output functions from a simulator library.  Code,
initialized data and zero-initialized data are allocated consecutively.

<p><em>CR16 Options</em>
</p>

<p>These options are defined specifically for the CR16 ports.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mmac</dt><dd>

Enable the use of multiply-accumulate instructions. Disabled by default.
      </dd><dt>-mcr16cplus</dt>


      <dt>-mcr16c</dt><dd>


Generate code for CR16C or CR16C+ architecture. CR16C+ architecture 
is default.
      </dd><dt>-msim</dt><dd>

Links the library libsim.a which is in compatible with simulator. Applicable
to ELF compiler only.

Generates <em>`sbit'</em>/<em>`cbit'</em> instructions for bit manipulations.
      </dd><dt>-mdata-model=<em><code>model</code></em></dt><dd>

Choose a data model. The choices for <em>model</em> are <em>near</em>,
<em>far</em> or <em>medium</em>. <em>medium</em> is default.
However, <em>far</em> is not valid with <span class="option">-mcr16c</span>, as the
CR16C architecture does not support the far data model.

<p><em>Darwin Options</em>
</p>

<p>These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.</p>

<p>FSF GCC on Darwin does not create “fat” object files; it creates
an object file for the single architecture that GCC was built to
target.  Apple's GCC on Darwin does create “fat” files if multiple
<span class="option">-arch</span> options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
<em>lipo</em>.</p>

<p>The subtype of the file created (like <em>ppc7400</em> or <em>ppc970</em> or
<em>i686</em>) is determined by the flags that specify the ISA
that GCC is targeting, like <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a></span> or <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span>.  The
<span class="option">-force_cpusubtype_ALL</span> option can be used to override this.</p>

<p>The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA
mismatch.  The assembler, <em>as</em>, only permits instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64-bit instructions in a <em>ppc750</em> object file.
The linker for shared libraries, <code class="filename">/usr/bin/libtool</code>, fails
and prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a <em>ppc970</em> object file in a <em>ppc7400</em> library).  The linker
for executables, <em>ld</em>, quietly gives the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.</p>
      </dd><dt>-F<em><code>dir</code></em></dt><dd>

Add the framework directory <em>dir</em> to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span> options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.

<p>A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a <em>Headers</em> and/or
<em>PrivateHeaders</em> directory contained directly in it that ends
in <span class="markup">.framework</span>.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the <span class="markup">.framework</span>.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
<em>Headers</em> being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's <em>Frameworks</em> directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework; a warning is issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in <code class="filename">/System/Library/Frameworks</code> and
<code class="filename">/Library/Frameworks</code>.  An example include looks like
<em>`#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;'</em>, where <em>Framework</em> denotes
the name of the framework and <em>header.h</em> is found in the
<em>PrivateHeaders</em> or <em>Headers</em> directory.</p>

<span class="option">-mlong-branch</span> for PowerPC targets.

option has no effect on x86.

<p><em>Warning:</em> The <span class="option">-mone-byte-bool</span> switch causes GCC

These options are passed to the Darwin linker.  The Darwin linker man page
describes them in detail.

<p><em>DEC Alpha Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for the DEC Alpha implementations:</p>
      </dd><dt>-mno-soft-float</dt>


      <dt>-msoft-float</dt><dd>


Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> is specified,
functions in <em>libgcc.a</em> are used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.

<p>Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mfp-reg</dt>


      <dt>-mno-fp-regs</dt><dd>


Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
<span class="option">-mno-fp-regs</span> implies <span class="option">-msoft-float</span>.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in <em>$0</em> instead of <em>$f0</em>.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with <span class="option">-mno-fp-regs</span> must also be compiled with that
option.

<p>A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mieee</dt><dd>

The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the IEEE floating-point
standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code
<em>except</em> that the <em>inexact-flag</em> is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro <em>`_IEEE_FP'</em> is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional IEEE
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option <span class="option">-ieee_with_no_inexact</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mieee-with-inexact</dt><dd>

This is like <span class="option">-mieee</span> except the generated code also maintains
the IEEE <em>inexact-flag</em>.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant IEEE math.  In addition to
<em>`_IEEE_FP'</em>, <em>`_IEEE_FP_EXACT'</em> is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the <em>inexact-flag</em>, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option <span class="option">-ieee_with_inexact</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mfp-trap-mode=<em><code>trap-mode</code></em></dt><dd>

This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.
Other Alpha compilers call this option <span class="option">-fptm</span> <em><code>trap-mode</code></em>.
The trap mode can be set to one of four values:
        <dl class="same-line"><dt><em>n</em></dt><dd>

This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).
          </dd><dt><em>u</em></dt><dd>

In addition to the traps enabled by <em>n</em>, underflow traps are enabled
as well.
          </dd><dt><em>su</em></dt><dd>

Like <em>u</em>, but the instructions are marked to be safe for software
completion (see Alpha architecture manual for details).
          </dd><dt><em>sui</em></dt><dd>

Like <em>su</em>, but inexact traps are enabled as well.
          </dd></dl>

      </dd><dt>-mfp-rounding-mode=<em><code>rounding-mode</code></em></dt><dd>

Selects the IEEE rounding mode.  Other Alpha compilers call this option
<span class="option">-fprm</span> <em><code>rounding-mode</code></em>.  The <em>rounding-mode</em> can be one
of:
        <dl class="same-line"><dt><em>n</em></dt><dd>

Normal IEEE rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.
          </dd><dt><em>m</em></dt><dd>

Round towards minus infinity.
          </dd><dt><em>c</em></dt><dd>

Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.
          </dd><dt><em>d</em></dt><dd>

Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control register
(<em>fpcr</em>, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
<em>fpcr</em>, <em>d</em> corresponds to round towards plus infinity.
          </dd></dl>

      </dd><dt>-mtrap-precision=<em><code>trap-precision</code></em></dt><dd>

In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.  This
means without software assistance it is impossible to recover from a
floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated.
GCC can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating-point trap.
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:
        <dl class="same-line"><dt><em>p</em></dt><dd>

Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating-point exception.
          </dd><dt><code class="func-name">f</code></dt><dd>

Function precision.  The trap handler can determine the function that
caused a floating-point exception.
          </dd><dt><em>i</em></dt><dd>

Instruction precision.  The trap handler can determine the exact
instruction that caused a floating-point exception.
          </dd></dl>
      

<p>Other Alpha compilers provide the equivalent options called
<span class="option">-scope_safe</span> and <span class="option">-resumption_safe</span>.
        </p> 
      </dd><dt>-mieee-conformant</dt><dd>

This option marks the generated code as IEEE conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify <span class="option">-mtrap-precision=i</span> and either
<span class="option">-mfp-trap-mode=su</span> or <span class="option">-mfp-trap-mode=sui</span>.  Its only effect
is to emit the line <span class="markup">.eflag 48</span> in the function prologue of the
generated assembly file.
      </dd><dt>-mbuild-constants</dt><dd>

Normally GCC examines a 32- or 64-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal and
generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.

<p>Use this option to require GCC to construct <em>all</em> integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).</p>

<p>You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.</p>

      <dt>-mmax</dt>

      <dt>-mno-max</dt><dd>


Indicate whether GCC should generate code to use the optional BWX,
CIX, FIX and MAX instruction sets.  The default is to use the instruction
sets supported by the CPU type specified via <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=</span> option or that
of the CPU on which GCC was built if none is specified.
      </dd><dt>-mfloat-vax</dt>


      <dt>-mfloat-ieee</dt><dd>


Generate code that uses (does not use) VAX F and G floating-point
arithmetic instead of IEEE single and double precision.
      </dd><dt>-mexplicit-relocs</dt>


      <dt>-mno-explicit-relocs</dt><dd>


Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  GNU binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option
is mostly useful for debugging, as GCC detects the capabilities of
the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.
      </dd><dt>-msmall-data</dt>


      <dt>-mlarge-data</dt><dd>


When <span class="option">-mexplicit-relocs</span> is in effect, static data is
accessed via <em>gp-relative</em> relocations.  When <span class="option">-msmall-data</span>
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a <em>small data area</em>
(the <em>`.sdata'</em> and <em>`.sbss'</em> sections) and are accessed via
16-bit relocations off of the <em>$gp</em> register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.

<p>The default is <span class="option">-mlarge-data</span>.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use <em>`malloc'</em> or <em>`mmap'</em> to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.</p>

<p>When generating code for shared libraries, <span class="option">-fpic</span> implies
<span class="option">-msmall-data</span> and <span class="option">-fPIC</span> implies <span class="option">-mlarge-data</span>.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msmall-text</dt>


      <dt>-mlarge-text</dt><dd>


When <span class="option">-msmall-text</span> is used, the compiler assumes that the
code of the entire program (or shared library) fits in 4MB, and is
thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When <span class="option">-msmall-data</span>
is used, the compiler can assume that all local symbols share the
same <em>$gp</em> value, and thus reduce the number of instructions
required for a function call from 4 to 1.

<p>The default is <span class="option">-mlarge-text</span>.</p>
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=<em><code>cpu_type</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the instruction set and instruction scheduling parameters for
machine type <em>cpu_type</em>.  You can specify either the <em>EV</em>
style name or the corresponding chip number.  GCC supports scheduling
parameters for the EV4, EV5 and EV6 family of processors and
chooses the default values for the instruction set from the processor
you specify.  If you do not specify a processor type, GCC defaults

pointers to functions.  Without any PIC/PIE-related options, it
implies <span class="option">-fPIE</span>.  With <span class="option">-fpic</span> or <span class="option">-fpie</span>, it
assumes GOT entries and small data are within a 12-bit range from the
GOT base address; with <span class="option">-fPIC</span> or <span class="option">-fPIE</span>, GOT offsets
are computed with 32 bits.
With a <em>bfin-elf</em> target, this option implies <span class="option">-msim</span>.

      </dd><dt>-mgprel-ro</dt><dd>

Enable the use of <em>`GPREL'</em> relocations in the FDPIC ABI for data
that is known to be in read-only sections.  It's enabled by default,
except for <span class="option">-fpic</span> or <span class="option">-fpie</span>: even though it may help
make the global offset table smaller, it trades 1 instruction for 4.
With <span class="option">-fPIC</span> or <span class="option">-fPIE</span>, it trades 3 instructions for 4,
one of which may be shared by multiple symbols, and it avoids the need
for a GOT entry for the referenced symbol, so it's more likely to be a
win.  If it is not, <span class="option">-mno-gprel-ro</span> can be used to disable it.

      </dd><dt>-mbig-switch</dt><dd>

Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if
the assembler/linker complain about out-of-range branches within a switch
table.
      </dd><dt>-mjump-in-delay</dt><dd>

Fill delay slots of function calls with unconditional jump instructions
by modifying the return pointer for the function call to be the target
of the conditional jump.
      </dd><dt>-mdisable-fpregs</dt><dd>

Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.  This is
necessary for compiling kernels that perform lazy context switching of
floating-point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.
      </dd><dt>-mdisable-indexing</dt><dd>

Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some
rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.
      </dd><dt>-mno-space-regs</dt><dd>

Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.

<p>Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mfast-indirect-calls</dt><dd>

Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries.  This
allows GCC to emit code that performs faster indirect calls.

<p>This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries or nested
functions.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mfixed-range=<em><code>register-range</code></em></dt><dd>

Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
      </dd><dt>-mlong-load-store</dt><dd>

Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
the HP-UX 10 linker.  This is equivalent to the <em>+k</em> option to
the HP compilers.
      </dd><dt>-mportable-runtime</dt><dd>

Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.
      </dd><dt>-mgas</dt><dd>

Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.
      </dd><dt>-mschedule=<em><code>cpu-type</code></em></dt><dd>

Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
<em>cpu-type</em>.  The choices for <em>cpu-type</em> are <code class="literal">700</code>
<code class="literal">7100</code>, <em>7100LC</em>, <code class="literal">7200</code>, <code class="literal">7300</code> and <code class="literal">8000</code>.  Refer

proper scheduling option for your machine.  The default scheduling is
<code class="literal">8000</code>.
      </dd><dt>-mlinker-opt</dt><dd>

Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic
debugging impossible.  It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.
      </dd><dt>-msoft-float</dt><dd>

Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<em>Warning:</em> the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.

<p><span class="option">-msoft-float</span> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <em>libgcc.a</em>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> in order for
this to work.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msio</dt><dd>

Generate the predefine, <em>`_SIO'</em>, for server IO.  The default is
<span class="option">-mwsio</span>.  This generates the predefines, <em>`_ _hp9000s700'</em>,
<em>`_ _hp9000s700_ _'</em> and <em>`_WSIO'</em>, for workstation IO.  These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.
      </dd><dt>-mgnu-ld</dt><dd>

Use options specific to GNU <em>ld</em>.
This passes <span class="option">-shared</span> to <em>ld</em> when
building a shared library.  It is the default when GCC is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker.  This option does not
affect which <em>ld</em> is called; it only changes what parameters
are passed to that <em>ld</em>.
The <em>ld</em> that is called is determined by the
<span class="option">--with-ld</span> configure option, GCC's program search path, and
finally by the user's <em>PATH</em>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed
using <em>which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</em>.  This option is only available
on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with <em>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</em>.
      </dd><dt>-mhp-ld</dt><dd>

Use options specific to HP <em>ld</em>.
This passes <span class="option">-b</span> to <em>ld</em> when building
a shared library and passes <em>+Accept TypeMismatch</em> to <em>ld</em> on all
links.  It is the default when GCC is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the HP linker.  This option does not affect
which <em>ld</em> is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that
<em>ld</em>.
The <em>ld</em> that is called is determined by the <span class="option">--with-ld</span>
configure option, GCC's program search path, and finally by the user's
<em>PATH</em>.  The linker used by GCC can be printed using <em>which
`gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</em>.  This option is only available on the 64-bit
HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with <em>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</em>.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mlong-calls">-mlong-calls</a></dt><dd>

Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
PA 2.0 and PA 1.X architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.

<p>Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
<span class="option">-ffunction-sections</span> option, or when using the <span class="option">-mgas</span>
and <span class="option">-mno-portable-runtime</span> options together under HP-UX with
the SOM linker.</p>

<p>It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.</p>

<p>The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code
and it is quite long.</p>
      </dd><dt>-munix=<em><code>unix-std</code></em></dt><dd>

Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
UNIX standard.  The choices for <em>unix-std</em> are <code class="literal">93</code>, <code class="literal">95</code>
and <code class="literal">98</code>.  <code class="literal">93</code> is supported on all HP-UX versions.  <code class="literal">95</code>
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  <code class="literal">98</code> is available on HP-UX
11.11 and later.  The default values are <code class="literal">93</code> for HP-UX 10.00,
<code class="literal">95</code> for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and <code class="literal">98</code> for HP-UX 11.11
and later.

<p><span class="option">-munix=93</span> provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and 3.4.
<span class="option">-munix=95</span> provides additional predefines for <em>`XOPEN_UNIX'</em>
and <em>`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED'</em>, and the startfile <code class="filename">unix95.o</code>.
<span class="option">-munix=98</span> provides additional predefines for <em>`_XOPEN_UNIX'</em>,
<em>`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED'</em>, <em>`_INCLUDE_ _STDC_A1_SOURCE'</em> and
<em>`_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500'</em>, and the startfile <code class="filename">unix98.o</code>.</p>

<p>It is <em>important</em> to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, <em>extreme</em> care is needed in using this
option.</p>

<p>Library code that is intended to operate with more than one UNIX
standard must test, set and restore the variable <em>_ _xpg4_extended_mask</em>
as appropriate.  Most GNU software doesn't provide this capability.</p>
      </dd><dt>-nolibdld</dt><dd>

Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
<span class="option">-static</span> option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.
      </dd><dt>-static</dt><dd>

The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the <span class="option">-static</span> option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.

<p>On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the <span class="option">-static</span> option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
<span class="option">-nolibdld</span> option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from
adding these link options.</p>
      </dd><dt>-threads</dt><dd>

      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a>=<em><code>cpu-type</code></em></dt><dd>

Tune to <em>cpu-type</em> everything applicable about the generated code, except
for the ABI and the set of available instructions.  
While picking a specific <em>cpu-type</em> schedules things appropriately
for that particular chip, the compiler does not generate any code that
cannot run on the default machine type unless you use a
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=</span><em><code>cpu-type</code></em> option.
For example, if GCC is configured for i686-pc-linux-gnu
then <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a>=pentium4</span> generates code that is tuned for Pentium 4
but still runs on i686 machines.

<p>The choices for <em>cpu-type</em> are the same as for <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span>.
In addition, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a></span> supports an extra choice for <em>cpu-type</em>:</p>
        <dl><dt><em>generic</em></dt><dd>

Produce code optimized for the most common IA32/AMD64/EM64T processors.
If you know the CPU on which your code will run, then you should use
the corresponding <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a></span> or <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span> option instead of
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a>=generic</span>.  But, if you do not know exactly what CPU users
of your application will have, then you should use this option.

<p>As new processors are deployed in the marketplace, the behavior of this
option will change.  Therefore, if you upgrade to a newer version of
GCC, code generation controlled by this option will change to reflect
the processors
that are most common at the time that version of GCC is released.</p>

<p>There is no <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=generic</span> option because <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span>
indicates the instruction set the compiler can use, and there is no
generic instruction set applicable to all processors.  In contrast,
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a></span> indicates the processor (or, in this case, collection of
processors) for which the code is optimized.</p>

Generate floating-point arithmetic for selected unit <em>unit</em>.  The choices
for <em>unit</em> are:
        <dl><dt><code class="literal">387</code></dt><dd>

Use the standard 387 floating-point coprocessor present on the majority of chips and
emulated otherwise.  Code compiled with this option runs almost everywhere.
The temporary results are computed in 80-bit precision instead of the precision
specified by the type, resulting in slightly different results compared to most
of other chips.  See <span class="option">-ffloat-store</span> for more detailed description.

<p>This is the default choice for i386 compiler.</p>
          </dd><dt><em>sse</em></dt><dd>

Use scalar floating-point instructions present in the SSE instruction set.
This instruction set is supported by Pentium III and newer chips,
and in the AMD line
by Athlon-4, Athlon XP and Athlon MP chips.  The earlier version of the SSE
instruction set supports only single-precision arithmetic, thus the double and
extended-precision arithmetic are still done using 387.  A later version, present
only in Pentium 4 and AMD x86-64 chips, supports double-precision
arithmetic too.

<p>For the i386 compiler, you must use <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=</span><em><code>cpu-type</code></em>, <span class="option">-msse</span>
or <span class="option">-msse2</span> switches to enable SSE extensions and make this option
effective.  For the x86-64 compiler, these extensions are enabled by default.</p>

<p>The resulting code should be considerably faster in the majority of cases and avoid
the numerical instability problems of 387 code, but may break some existing
code that expects temporaries to be 80 bits.</p>

<p>This is the default choice for the x86-64 compiler.</p>

          <dt><em>sse+387</em></dt>

          <dt><em>both</em></dt><dd>


Attempt to utilize both instruction sets at once.  This effectively doubles the
amount of available registers, and on chips with separate execution units for
387 and SSE the execution resources too.  Use this option with care, as it is
still experimental, because the GCC register allocator does not model separate
functional units well, resulting in unstable performance.

      </dd><dt>-msoft-float</dt><dd>

Generate output containing library calls for floating point.

<p><em>Warning:</em> the requisite libraries are not part of GCC.
Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are used, but
this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make your
own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.</p>

<p>On machines where a function returns floating-point results in the 80387
register stack, some floating-point opcodes may be emitted even if
<span class="option">-msoft-float</span> is used.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mno-fp-ret-in-387</dt><dd>

Do not use the FPU registers for return values of functions.

<p>The usual calling convention has functions return values of types
<em>`float'</em> and <em>`double'</em> in an FPU register, even if there
is no FPU.  The idea is that the operating system should emulate
an FPU.</p>

<p>The option <span class="option">-mno-fp-ret-in-387</span> causes such values to be returned
in ordinary CPU registers instead.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mno-fancy-math-387</dt><dd>

Some 387 emulators do not support the <em>`sin'</em>, <em>`cos'</em> and
<em>`sqrt'</em> instructions for the 387.  Specify this option to avoid
generating those instructions.  This option is the default on FreeBSD,
OpenBSD and NetBSD.  This option is overridden when <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span>
indicates that the target CPU always has an FPU and so the
instruction does not need emulation.  These
instructions are not generated unless you also use the
<span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span> switch.
      </dd><dt>-malign-double</dt>


      <dt>-mno-align-double</dt><dd>


Control whether GCC aligns <em>`double'</em>, <em>`long double'</em>, and
<em>`long long'</em> variables on a two-word boundary or a one-word
boundary.  Aligning <em>`double'</em> variables on a two-word boundary
produces code that runs somewhat faster on a Pentium at the
expense of more memory.

<p>On x86-64, <span class="option">-malign-double</span> is enabled by default.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> if you use the <span class="option">-malign-double</span> switch,
structures containing the above types are aligned differently than
the published application binary interface specifications for the 386
and are not binary compatible with structures in code compiled
without that switch.</p>
      </dd><dt>-m96bit-long-double</dt>


      <dt>-m128bit-long-double</dt><dd>


These switches control the size of <em>`long double'</em> type.  The i386
application binary interface specifies the size to be 96 bits,
so <span class="option">-m96bit-long-double</span> is the default in 32-bit mode.

<p>Modern architectures (Pentium and newer) prefer <em>`long double'</em>
to be aligned to an 8- or 16-byte boundary.  In arrays or structures
conforming to the ABI, this is not possible.  So specifying
<span class="option">-m128bit-long-double</span> aligns <em>`long double'</em>
to a 16-byte boundary by padding the <em>`long double'</em> with an additional
32-bit zero.</p>

<p>In the x86-64 compiler, <span class="option">-m128bit-long-double</span> is the default choice as
its ABI specifies that <em>`long double'</em> is aligned on 16-byte boundary.</p>

<p>Notice that neither of these options enable any extra precision over the x87
standard of 80 bits for a <em>`long double'</em>.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> if you override the default value for your target ABI, this
changes the size of 
structures and arrays containing <em>`long double'</em> variables,
as well as modifying the function calling convention for functions taking
<em>`long double'</em>.  Hence they are not binary-compatible
with code compiled without that switch.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mlong-double-64</dt>


      <dt>-mlong-double-80</dt><dd>


These switches control the size of <em>`long double'</em> type. A size
of 64 bits makes the <em>`long double'</em> type equivalent to the <em>`double'</em>
type. This is the default for Bionic C library.

<p><em>Warning:</em> if you override the default value for your target ABI, this
changes the size of
structures and arrays containing <em>`long double'</em> variables,
as well as modifying the function calling convention for functions taking
<em>`long double'</em>.  Hence they are not binary-compatible
with code compiled without that switch.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mlarge-data-threshold=<em><code>threshold</code></em></dt><dd>

When <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcmodel">-mcmodel</a>=medium</span> is specified, data objects larger than
<em>threshold</em> are placed in the large data section.  This value must be the
same across all objects linked into the binary, and defaults to 65535.
      </dd><dt>-mrtd</dt><dd>

Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions that
take a fixed number of arguments return with the <em>`ret </em><em>num</em><em>'</em>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This saves one
instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop the arguments
there.

<p>You can specify that an individual function is called with this calling
sequence with the function attribute <em>stdcall</em>.  You can also
override the <span class="option">-mrtd</span> option by using the function attribute
<em>cdecl</em>.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> this calling convention is incompatible with the one
normally used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call
libraries compiled with the Unix compiler.</p>

<p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <em>`printf'</em>);
otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those
functions.</p>

<p>In addition, seriously incorrect code results if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)</p>
      </dd><dt>-mregparm=<em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

Control how many registers are used to pass integer arguments.  By
default, no registers are used to pass arguments, and at most 3
registers can be used.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute <em>regparm</em>.

<p><em>Warning:</em> if you use this switch, and
<em>num</em> is nonzero, then you must build all modules with the same
value, including any libraries.  This includes the system libraries and
startup modules.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msseregparm</dt><dd>

Use SSE register passing conventions for float and double arguments
and return values.  You can control this behavior for a specific
function by using the function attribute <em>sseregparm</em>.

<p><em>Warning:</em> if you use this switch then you must build all
modules with the same value, including any libraries.  This includes
the system libraries and startup modules.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mvect8-ret-in-mem</dt><dd>

Return 8-byte vectors in memory instead of MMX registers.  This is the
default on Solaris@tie{}8 and 9 and VxWorks to match the ABI of the Sun
Studio compilers until version 12.  Later compiler versions (starting
with Studio 12 Update@tie{}1) follow the ABI used by other x86 targets, which
is the default on Solaris@tie{}10 and later.  <em>Only</em> use this option if
you need to remain compatible with existing code produced by those
previous compiler versions or older versions of GCC.
      </dd><dt>-mpc32</dt>


      <dt>-mpc64</dt>

      <dt>-mpc80</dt><dd>


Set 80387 floating-point precision to 32, 64 or 80 bits.  When <span class="option">-mpc32</span>
is specified, the significands of results of floating-point operations are
rounded to 24 bits (single precision); <span class="option">-mpc64</span> rounds the
significands of results of floating-point operations to 53 bits (double
precision) and <span class="option">-mpc80</span> rounds the significands of results of
floating-point operations to 64 bits (extended double precision), which is
the default.  When this option is used, floating-point operations in higher
precisions are not available to the programmer without setting the FPU
control word explicitly.

<p>Setting the rounding of floating-point operations to less than the default
80 bits can speed some programs by 2% or more.  Note that some mathematical
libraries assume that extended-precision (80-bit) floating-point operations
are enabled by default; routines in such libraries could suffer significant
loss of accuracy, typically through so-called “catastrophic cancellation”,
when this option is used to set the precision to less than extended precision.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mstackrealign</dt><dd>

Realign the stack at entry.  On the Intel x86, the <span class="option">-mstackrealign</span>
option generates an alternate prologue and epilogue that realigns the
run-time stack if necessary.  This supports mixing legacy codes that keep
4-byte stack alignment with modern codes that keep 16-byte stack alignment for
SSE compatibility.  See also the attribute <em>`force_align_arg_pointer'</em>,
applicable to individual functions.
      </dd><dt>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=<em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <em>num</em>
byte boundary.  If <span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary</span> is not specified,
the default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).

<p><em>Warning:</em> When generating code for the x86-64 architecture with
SSE extensions disabled, <span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</span> can be
used to keep the stack boundary aligned to 8 byte boundary.  Since
x86-64 ABI require 16 byte stack alignment, this is ABI incompatible and
intended to be used in controlled environment where stack space is
important limitation.  This option will lead to wrong code when functions
compiled with 16 byte stack alignment (such as functions from a standard
library) are called with misaligned stack.  In this case, SSE
instructions may lead to misaligned memory access traps.  In addition,
variable arguments will be handled incorrectly for 16 byte aligned
objects (including x87 long double and _ _int128), leading to wrong
results.  You must build all modules with
<span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</span>, including any libraries.  This
includes the system libraries and startup modules.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mincoming-stack-boundary=<em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to <em>num</em> byte
boundary.  If <span class="option">-mincoming-stack-boundary</span> is not specified,
the one specified by <span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary</span> is used.

<p>On Pentium and Pentium Pro, <em>`double'</em> and <em>`long double'</em> values
should be aligned to an 8-byte boundary (see <span class="option">-malign-double</span>) or
suffer significant run time performance penalties.  On Pentium III, the
Streaming SIMD Extension (SSE) data type <em>`_ _m128'</em> may not work
properly if it is not 16-byte aligned.</p>

<p>To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.</p>

<p>This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to <span class="option">-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</span>.</p>

<p>To generate SSE/SSE2 instructions automatically from floating-point

<p>GCC depresses SSEx instructions when <span class="option">-mavx</span> is used. Instead, it

<p>These options enable GCC to use these extended instructions in
generated code, even without <span class="option">-mfpmath=sse</span>.  Applications that
perform run-time CPU detection must compile separate files for each

      </dd><dt>-mcld</dt><dd>

This option instructs GCC to emit a <em>`cld'</em> instruction in the prologue
of functions that use string instructions.  String instructions depend on
the DF flag to select between autoincrement or autodecrement mode.  While the
ABI specifies the DF flag to be cleared on function entry, some operating
systems violate this specification by not clearing the DF flag in their
exception dispatchers.  The exception handler can be invoked with the DF flag
set, which leads to wrong direction mode when string instructions are used.
This option can be enabled by default on 32-bit x86 targets by configuring
GCC with the <span class="option">--enable-cld</span> configure option.  Generation of <em>`cld'</em>
instructions can be suppressed with the <span class="option">-mno-cld</span> compiler option
in this case.
      </dd><dt>-mvzeroupper</dt><dd>

This option instructs GCC to emit a <em>`vzeroupper'</em> instruction
before a transfer of control flow out of the function to minimize
the AVX to SSE transition penalty as well as remove unnecessary <em>`zeroupper'</em>
intrinsics.
      </dd><dt>-mprefer-avx128</dt><dd>

This option instructs GCC to use 128-bit AVX instructions instead of
256-bit AVX instructions in the auto-vectorizer.
      </dd><dt>-mcx16</dt><dd>

This option enables GCC to generate <em>`CMPXCHG16B'</em> instructions.
<em>`CMPXCHG16B'</em> allows for atomic operations on 128-bit double quadword
(or oword) data types.  
This is useful for high-resolution counters that can be updated
by multiple processors (or cores).  This instruction is generated as part of
atomic built-in functions: see <em>_ _sync Builtins</em> or
<em>_ _atomic Builtins</em> for details.
      </dd><dt>-msahf</dt><dd>

This option enables generation of <em>`SAHF'</em> instructions in 64-bit code.
Early Intel Pentium 4 CPUs with Intel 64 support,
prior to the introduction of Pentium 4 G1 step in December 2005,
lacked the <em>`LAHF'</em> and <em>`SAHF'</em> instructions
which were supported by AMD64.
These are load and store instructions, respectively, for certain status flags.
In 64-bit mode, the <em>`SAHF'</em> instruction is used to optimize <em>`fmod'</em>,
<em>`drem'</em>, and <em>`remainder'</em> built-in functions;
see <em>Other Builtins</em> for details.
      </dd><dt>-mmovbe</dt><dd>

This option enables use of the <em>`movbe'</em> instruction to implement
<em>`_ _builtin_bswap32'</em> and <em>`_ _builtin_bswap64'</em>.
      </dd><dt>-mcrc32</dt><dd>

This option enables built-in functions <em>`_ _builtin_ia32_crc32qi'</em>,
<em>`_ _builtin_ia32_crc32hi'</em>, <em>`_ _builtin_ia32_crc32si'</em> and
<em>`_ _builtin_ia32_crc32di'</em> to generate the <em>`crc32'</em> machine instruction.
      </dd><dt>-mrecip</dt><dd>

This option enables use of <em>`RCPSS'</em> and <em>`RSQRTSS'</em> instructions
(and their vectorized variants <em>`RCPPS'</em> and <em>`RSQRTPS'</em>)
with an additional Newton-Raphson step
to increase precision instead of <em>`DIVSS'</em> and <em>`SQRTSS'</em>
(and their vectorized
variants) for single-precision floating-point arguments.  These instructions
are generated only when <span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span> is enabled
together with <span class="option">-finite-math-only</span> and <span class="option">-fno-trapping-math</span>.
Note that while the throughput of the sequence is higher than the throughput
of the non-reciprocal instruction, the precision of the sequence can be
decreased by up to 2 ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994).

<p>Note that GCC implements <em>`1.0f/sqrtf(</em><var>x</var><em>)'</em> in terms of <em>`RSQRTSS'</em>
(or <em>`RSQRTPS'</em>) already with <span class="option">-ffast-math</span> (or the above option
combination), and doesn't need <span class="option">-mrecip</span>.</p>

<p>Also note that GCC emits the above sequence with additional Newton-Raphson step
for vectorized single-float division and vectorized <em>`sqrtf(</em><var>x</var><em>)'</em>
already with <span class="option">-ffast-math</span> (or the above option combination), and
doesn't need <span class="option">-mrecip</span>.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mrecip=<em><code>opt</code></em></dt><dd>

This option controls which reciprocal estimate instructions

Generate code for the specified calling convention.  Permissible values
are <em>sysv</em> for the ABI used on GNU/Linux and other systems, and
<em>ms</em> for the Microsoft ABI.  The default is to use the Microsoft
ABI when targeting Microsoft Windows and the SysV ABI on all other systems.

      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtls-dialect">-mtls-dialect</a>=<em><code>type</code></em></dt><dd>

Generate code to access thread-local storage using the <em>gnu</em> or
<em>gnu2</em> conventions.  <em>gnu</em> is the conservative default;
<em>gnu2</em> is more efficient, but it may add compile- and run-time
requirements that cannot be satisfied on all systems.
      </dd><dt>-mpush-args</dt>


      <dt>-mno-push-args</dt><dd>


Use PUSH operations to store outgoing parameters.  This method is shorter
and usually equally fast as method using SUB/MOV operations and is enabled
by default.  In some cases disabling it may improve performance because of
improved scheduling and reduced dependencies.
      </dd><dt>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</dt><dd>

If enabled, the maximum amount of space required for outgoing arguments is
computed in the function prologue.  This is faster on most modern CPUs
because of reduced dependencies, improved scheduling and reduced stack usage
when the preferred stack boundary is not equal to 2.  The drawback is a notable
increase in code size.  This switch implies <span class="option">-mno-push-args</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mthreads</dt><dd>

Support thread-safe exception handling on MinGW.  Programs that rely
on thread-safe exception handling must compile and link all code with the
<span class="option">-mthreads</span> option.  When compiling, <span class="option">-mthreads</span> defines
<em>`-D_MT'</em>; when linking, it links in a special thread helper library
<span class="option">-lmingwthrd</span> which cleans up per-thread exception-handling data.
      </dd><dt>-mno-align-stringops</dt><dd>

Do not align the destination of inlined string operations.  This switch reduces
code size and improves performance in case the destination is already aligned,
but GCC doesn't know about it.
      </dd><dt>-minline-all-stringops</dt><dd>

By default GCC inlines string operations only when the destination is 
known to be aligned to least a 4-byte boundary.  
This enables more inlining and increases code
size, but may improve performance of code that depends on fast
<em>`memcpy'</em>, <em>`strlen'</em>,
and <em>`memset'</em> for short lengths.
      </dd><dt>-minline-stringops-dynamically</dt><dd>

For string operations of unknown size, use run-time checks with

      </dd><dt>-momit-leaf-frame-pointer</dt><dd>

Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for leaf functions.  This
avoids the instructions to save, set up, and restore frame pointers and
makes an extra register available in leaf functions.  The option
<span class="option">-fomit-leaf-frame-pointer</span> removes the frame pointer for leaf functions,
which might make debugging harder.
      </dd><dt>-mtls-direct-seg-refs</dt>


      <dt>-mno-tls-direct-seg-refs</dt><dd>


Controls whether TLS variables may be accessed with offsets from the
TLS segment register (<em>%gs</em> for 32-bit, <em>%fs</em> for 64-bit),
or whether the thread base pointer must be added.  Whether or not this
is valid depends on the operating system, and whether it maps the
segment to cover the entire TLS area.

<p>For systems that use the GNU C Library, the default is on.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msse2avx</dt>

      <dt>-mno-8bit-idiv</dt><dd>


On some processors, like Intel Atom, 8-bit unsigned integer divide is
much faster than 32-bit/64-bit integer divide.  This option generates a
run-time check.  If both dividend and divisor are within range of 0

      </dd><dt>-mno-red-zone</dt><dd>

Do not use a so-called “red zone” for x86-64 code.  The red zone is mandated
by the x86-64 ABI; it is a 128-byte area beyond the location of the
stack pointer that is not modified by signal or interrupt handlers
and therefore can be used for temporary data without adjusting the stack
pointer.  The flag <span class="option">-mno-red-zone</span> disables this red zone.

      </dd><dt>-mno-sched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns</dt>


      <dt>-msched-prefer-non-data-spec-insns</dt><dd>


If enabled, data-speculative instructions are chosen for schedule
only if there are no other choices at the moment.  This makes
the use of the data speculation much more conservative.
The default is 'disable'.
      </dd><dt>-mno-sched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns</dt>


      <dt>-msched-prefer-non-control-spec-insns</dt><dd>

the use of the control speculation much more conservative.
The default is 'disable'.
      </dd><dt>-mno-sched-count-spec-in-critical-path</dt>


      <dt>-msched-count-spec-in-critical-path</dt><dd>


If enabled, speculative dependencies are considered during
computation of the instructions priorities.  This makes the use of the
speculation a bit more conservative.
The default is 'disable'.
      </dd><dt>-msched-spec-ldc</dt><dd>

Use a simple data speculation check.  This option is on by default.
      </dd><dt>-msched-control-spec-ldc</dt><dd>

Use a simple check for control speculation.  This option is on by default.
      </dd><dt>-msched-stop-bits-after-every-cycle</dt><dd>

Place a stop bit after every cycle when scheduling.  This option is on
by default.
      </dd><dt>-msched-fp-mem-deps-zero-cost</dt><dd>

Assume that floating-point stores and loads are not likely to cause a conflict
when placed into the same instruction group.  This option is disabled by

Generate checks for control speculation in selective scheduling.
This flag is disabled by default.
      </dd><dt>-msched-max-memory-insns=<em><code>max-insns</code></em></dt><dd>

Limit on the number of memory insns per instruction group, giving lower

instruction group. Frequently useful to prevent cache bank conflicts.
The default value is 1.
      </dd><dt>-msched-max-memory-insns-hard-limit</dt><dd>

Makes the limit specified by <em>msched-max-memory-insns</em> a hard limit,
disallowing more than that number in an instruction group.
Otherwise, the limit is “soft”, meaning that non-memory operations
are preferred when the limit is reached, but memory operations may still
be scheduled.

<p><em>LM32 Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for the LatticeMico32 architecture:</p>
      </dd><dt>-mbarrel-shift-enabled</dt><dd>

Enable barrel-shift instructions.
      </dd><dt>-mdivide-enabled</dt><dd>

Enable divide and modulus instructions.
      </dd><dt>-mmultiply-enabled</dt><dd>

Enable multiply instructions.
      </dd><dt>-msign-extend-enabled</dt><dd>

Enable sign extend instructions.

Enable user-defined instructions.

<p><em>M32C Options</em>
</p>
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Select the CPU for which code is generated.  <em>name</em> may be one of
<em>r8c</em> for the R8C/Tiny series, <em>m16c</em> for the M16C (up to
/60) series, <em>m32cm</em> for the M16C/80 series, or <em>m32c</em> for
the M32C/80 series.
      </dd><dt>-msim</dt><dd>

Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator.  This causes
an alternate runtime library to be linked in which supports, for
example, file I/O.  You must not use this option when generating
programs that will run on real hardware; you must provide your own
runtime library for whatever I/O functions are needed.
      </dd><dt>-memregs=<em><code>number</code></em></dt><dd>

Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC uses
during code generation.  These pseudo-registers are used like real
registers, so there is a tradeoff between GCC's ability to fit the
code into available registers, and the performance penalty of using
memory instead of registers.  Note that all modules in a program must
be compiled with the same value for this option.  Because of that, you
must not use this option with GCC's default runtime libraries.

<p><em>M32R/D Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for Renesas M32R/D architectures:</p>

Generate code for the M32R/X.
      </dd><dt>-m32r</dt><dd>

Generate code for the M32R.  This is the default.
      </dd><dt>-mmodel=small</dt><dd>

Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their addresses
can be loaded with the <em>`ld24'</em> instruction), and assume all subroutines
are reachable with the <em>`bl'</em> instruction.
This is the default.

<p>The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
<em>`model'</em> attribute.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mmodel=medium</dt><dd>

Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the compiler
generates <em>`seth/add3'</em> instructions to load their addresses), and
assume all subroutines are reachable with the <em>`bl'</em> instruction.
      </dd><dt>-mmodel=large</dt><dd>

Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32-bit address space (the compiler
generates <em>`seth/add3'</em> instructions to load their addresses), and
assume subroutines may not be reachable with the <em>`bl'</em> instruction
(the compiler generates the much slower <em>`seth/add3/jl'</em>
instruction sequence).
      </dd><dt>-msdata=none</dt><dd>

Disable use of the small data area.  Variables are put into
one of <span class="markup">.data</span>, <span class="markup">.bss</span>, or <span class="markup">.rodata</span> (unless the
<em>`section'</em> attribute has been specified).
This is the default.

<p>The small data area consists of sections <span class="markup">.sdata</span> and <span class="markup">.sbss</span>.
Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
<em>`section'</em> attribute using one of these sections.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msdata=sdata</dt><dd>

Put small global and static data in the small data area, but do not
generate special code to reference them.
      </dd><dt>-msdata=use</dt><dd>

Put small global and static data in the small data area, and generate
special instructions to reference them.
      </dd><dt>-G <em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

Put global and static objects less than or equal to <em>num</em> bytes
into the small data or BSS sections instead of the normal data or BSS
sections.  The default value of <em>num</em> is 8.
The <span class="option">-msdata</span> option must be set to one of <em>sdata</em> or <em>use</em>
for this option to have any effect.

<p>All modules should be compiled with the same <span class="option">-G</span> <em><code>num</code></em> value.
Compiling with different values of <em>num</em> may or may not work; if it
doesn't the linker gives an error message---incorrect code is not
generated.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mdebug</dt><dd>

Makes the M32R-specific code in the compiler display some statistics
that might help in debugging programs.
      </dd><dt>-malign-loops</dt><dd>

Align all loops to a 32-byte boundary.
      </dd><dt>-mno-align-loops</dt><dd>

Do not enforce a 32-byte alignment for loops.  This is the default.

or 2.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mbranch-cost">-mbranch-cost</a>=<em><code>number</code></em></dt><dd>

<em>number</em> can only be 1 or 2.  If it is 1 then branches are
preferred over conditional code, if it is 2, then the opposite applies.
      </dd><dt>-mflush-trap=<em><code>number</code></em></dt><dd>

Specifies the trap number to use to flush the cache.  The default is
12.  Valid numbers are between 0 and 15 inclusive.
      </dd><dt>-mno-flush-trap</dt><dd>

Specifies that the cache cannot be flushed by using a trap.
      </dd><dt>-mflush-func=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Specifies the name of the operating system function to call to flush
the cache.  The default is <em>_flush_cache</em>, but a function call
is only used if a trap is not available.
      </dd><dt>-mno-flush-func</dt><dd>

Indicates that there is no OS function for flushing the cache.

<p><em>M680x0 Options</em>
</p>

<p>These are the <span class="option">-m</span> options defined for M680x0 and ColdFire processors.

instructions.  If <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span> is used without <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a></span>,
the default is “on” for ColdFire architectures and “off” for M680x0

(either the default CPU, or the one specified by <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a></span>).  For
example, the default is “off” for <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=5206</span> and “on” for

      </dd><dt>-mshort</dt><dd>

Consider type <em>`int'</em> to be 16 bits wide, like <em>`short int'</em>.
Additionally, parameters passed on the stack are also aligned to a

Do not consider type <em>`int'</em> to be 16 bits wide.  This is the default.

      <dt>-mno-bitfield</dt><dd>


Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The <span class="option">-m68000</span>, <span class="option">-mcpu32</span>
and <span class="option">-m5200</span> options imply <span class="option">-mnobitfield</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mbitfield</dt><dd>

Do use the bit-field instructions.  The <span class="option">-m68020</span> option implies
<span class="option">-mbitfield</span>.  This is the default if you use a configuration
designed for a 68020.
      </dd><dt>-mrtd</dt><dd>

Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
that take a fixed number of arguments return with the <em>`rtd'</em>
instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
the arguments there.

<p>This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally
used on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
compiled with the Unix compiler.</p>

<p>Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
take variable numbers of arguments (including <em>`printf'</em>);
otherwise incorrect code is generated for calls to those
functions.</p>

<p>In addition, seriously incorrect code results if you call a
function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
harmlessly ignored.)</p>

<p>The <em>`rtd'</em> instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,
68040, 68060 and CPU32 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mno-rtd</dt><dd>

Do not use the calling conventions selected by <span class="option">-mrtd</span>.
This is the default.
      </dd><dt>-malign-int</dt>


      <dt>-mno-align-int</dt><dd>


Control whether GCC aligns <em>`int'</em>, <em>`long'</em>, <em>`long long'</em>,
<em>`float'</em>, <em>`double'</em>, and <em>`long double'</em> variables on a 32-bit
boundary (<span class="option">-malign-int</span>) or a 16-bit boundary (<span class="option">-mno-align-int</span>).
Aligning variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more memory.

<p><em>Warning:</em> if you use the <span class="option">-malign-int</span> switch, GCC
aligns structures containing the above types differently than
most published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mpcrel</dt><dd>

Use the pc-relative addressing mode of the 68000 directly, instead of
using a global offset table.  At present, this option implies <span class="option">-fpic</span>,
allowing at most a 16-bit offset for pc-relative addressing.  <span class="option">-fPIC</span> is
not presently supported with <span class="option">-mpcrel</span>, though this could be supported for
68020 and higher processors.

Do not (do) assume that unaligned memory references are handled by
the system.
      </dd><dt>-msep-data</dt><dd>

Generate code that allows the data segment to be located in a different
area of memory from the text segment.  This allows for execute-in-place in
an environment without virtual memory management.  This option implies
<span class="option">-fPIC</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mno-sep-data</dt><dd>

Generate code that assumes that the data segment follows the text segment.
This is the default.
      </dd><dt>-mid-shared-library</dt><dd>

Generate code that supports shared libraries via the library ID method.
This allows for execute-in-place and shared libraries in an environment
without virtual memory management.  This option implies <span class="option">-fPIC</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mno-id-shared-library</dt><dd>

Generate code that doesn't assume ID-based shared libraries are being used.
This is the default.
      </dd><dt>-mshared-library-id=n</dt><dd>

Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being
compiled.  Specifying a value of 0 generates more compact code; specifying
other values forces the allocation of that number to the current
library, but is no more space- or time-efficient than omitting this option.
      </dd><dt>-mxgot</dt>


      <dt>-mno-xgot</dt><dd>


When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code
that works if the GOT has more than 8192 entries.  This code is
larger and slower than code generated without this option.  On M680x0
processors, this option is not needed; <span class="option">-fPIC</span> suffices.

<p>GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT.
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:</p>

<pre><code>relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar</code></pre> 

<p>If this happens, you should recompile your code with <span class="option">-mxgot</span>.
It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated with
<span class="option">-mxgot</span> is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to fetch
the value of a global symbol.</p>

<p>Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the GNU linker,
can create multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries.  If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use <span class="option">-mxgot</span> when compiling a single
object file that accesses more than 8192 GOT entries.  Very few do.</p>

<p>These options have no effect unless GCC is generating
position-independent code.</p>

The special value <em>from-abi</em> selects the
most compatible architecture for the selected ABI (that is,
<em>mips1</em> for 32-bit ABIs and <em>mips3</em> for 64-bit ABIs).

<p>The native Linux/GNU toolchain also supports the value <em>native</em>,
which selects the best architecture option for the host processor.
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=native</span> has no effect if GCC does not recognize
the processor.</p>

<p>In processor names, a final <code class="literal">000</code> can be abbreviated as <em>k</em>
(for example, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=r2k</span>).  Prefixes are optional, and
<em>vr</em> may be written <em>r</em>.</p>

<p>Names of the form <em>n</em><em>f2_1</em> refer to processors with
FPUs clocked at half the rate of the core, names of the form
<em>n</em><em>f1_1</em> refer to processors with FPUs clocked at the same
rate as the core, and names of the form <em>n</em><em>f3_2</em> refer to
processors with FPUs clocked a ratio of 3:2 with respect to the core.
For compatibility reasons, <em>n</em><code class="func-name">f</code> is accepted as a synonym
for <em>n</em><em>f2_1</em> while <em>n</em><var>x</var> and <em>b</em><em>fx</em> are
accepted as synonyms for <em>n</em><em>f1_1</em>.</p>

<p>GCC defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first
is <em>_MIPS_ARCH</em>, which gives the name of target architecture, as
a string.  The second has the form <em>_MIPS_ARCH_</em><code class="func-name">foo</code>,
where <code class="func-name">foo</code> is the capitalized value of <em>_MIPS_ARCH</em>.
For example, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=r2000</span> sets <em>_MIPS_ARCH</em>
to <em>“r2000”</em> and defines the macro <em>_MIPS_ARCH_R2000</em>.</p>

<p>Note that the <em>_MIPS_ARCH</em> macro uses the processor names given
above.  In other words, it has the full prefix and does not
abbreviate <code class="literal">000</code> as <em>k</em>.  In the case of <em>from-abi</em>,
the macro names the resolved architecture (either <em>“mips1”</em> or
<em>“mips3”</em>).  It names the default architecture when no
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span> option is given.</p>
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a>=<em><code>arch</code></em></dt><dd>

Optimize for <em>arch</em>.  Among other things, this option controls
the way instructions are scheduled, and the perceived cost of arithmetic
operations.  The list of <em>arch</em> values is the same as for
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span>.

<p>When this option is not used, GCC optimizes for the processor
specified by <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span>.  By using <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a></span> and
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a></span> together, it is possible to generate code that
runs on a family of processors, but optimize the code for one
particular member of that family.</p>

<p><span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a></span> defines the macros <em>_MIPS_TUNE</em> and

<p>For example, code using the standard ISA encoding cannot jump directly

Generate code for the given ABI.

<p>Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant.  GCC normally
generates 64-bit code when you select a 64-bit architecture, but you
can use <span class="option">-mgp32</span> to get 32-bit code instead.</p>

<p>For information about the O64 ABI, see
&lt;<em><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html">gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html</a></em>&gt;.</p>

<p>GCC supports a variant of the o32 ABI in which floating-point registers
are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.  You can select this combination with
<span class="option">-mabi=32</span> <span class="option">-mfp64</span>.  This ABI relies on the <em>`mthc1'</em>
and <em>`mfhc1'</em> instructions and is therefore only supported for
MIPS32R2 processors.</p>

<p>The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64-bit register
rather than a pair of 32-bit registers.  For example, scalar
floating-point values are returned in <em>$f0</em> only, not a
<em>$f0</em>/<em>$f1</em> pair.  The set of call-saved registers also
remains the same, but all 64 bits are saved.</p>

Generate (do not generate) code that is fully position-independent,

only affects <span class="option">-mabicalls</span>.

<p>All <span class="option">-mabicalls</span> code has traditionally been position-independent,
regardless of options like <span class="option">-fPIC</span> and <span class="option">-fpic</span>.  However,
as an extension, the GNU toolchain allows executables to use absolute
accesses for locally-binding symbols.  It can also use shorter GP
initialization sequences and generate direct calls to locally-defined
functions.  This mode is selected by <span class="option">-mno-shared</span>.</p>

<p><span class="option">-mno-shared</span> depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and generates
objects that can only be linked by the GNU linker.  However, the option
does not affect the ABI of the final executable; it only affects the ABI
of relocatable objects.  Using <span class="option">-mno-shared</span> generally makes
executables both smaller and quicker.</p>

Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global
offset table.

<p>GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the GOT.
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:</p>

<pre><code>relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar</code></pre> 

<p>If this happens, you should recompile your code with <span class="option">-mxgot</span>.
This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also
less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.</p>

<p>Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use <span class="option">-mxgot</span> when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of GOT entries.  Very few do.</p>

<p>These options have no effect unless GCC is generating position
independent code.</p>

These options control the treatment of the special not-a-number (NaN)

<p>By default or when the <span class="option">-mabs=legacy</span> is used the legacy

arithmetic and avoided where correct operation is required and the
input operand might be a NaN.  A longer sequence of instructions that
manipulate the sign bit of floating-point datum manually is used
instead unless the <span class="option">-ffinite-math-only</span> option has also been
specified.</p>

<p>The <span class="option">-mabs=2008</span> option selects the IEEE 754-2008 treatment.  In
this case these instructions are considered non-arithmetic and therefore
operating correctly in all cases, including in particular where the

for the respective operations.</p>

These options control the encoding of the special not-a-number (NaN)

<p>The <span class="option">-mnan=legacy</span> option selects the legacy encoding.  In this
case quiet NaNs (qNaNs) are denoted by the first bit of their trailing
significand field being 0, whereas signalling NaNs (sNaNs) are denoted
by the first bit of their trailing significand field being 1.</p>

<p>The <span class="option">-mnan=2008</span> option selects the IEEE 754-2008 encoding.  In
this case qNaNs are denoted by the first bit of their trailing

“F1” and “F2” floating-point errata.)
      </dd><dt>-mr10k-cache-barrier=<em><code>setting</code></em></dt><dd>

Specify whether GCC should insert cache barriers to avoid the
side-effects of speculation on R10K processors.

<p>In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome
of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions from
the “taken” branch.  It later aborts these instructions if the
predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the R10K, even aborted
instructions can have side effects.</p>

<p>This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system,
kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed store may load
the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if
the store itself is later aborted.  If a DMA operation writes to the
same area of memory before the “dirty” line is flushed, the cached
data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
for a full description, including other potential problems.</p>

<p>One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every memory
access that might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted.  <span class="option">-mr10k-cache-barrier=</span><em><code>setting</code></em>
controls GCC's implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
side effects:</p>
        <dl class="same-line"><dt>1.</dt><dd>
the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;
          </dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>
the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;
          </dd><dt>3.</dt><dd>
the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.
          </dd></dl>
      

<p>It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
accesses to these regions are indeed safe.</p>

<p>If the input program contains a function declaration such as:</p>

<pre><code>void <span class="func-name">foo</span>(<var>void</var>);<br><br></code></pre> 
<p>then the implementation of <em>`foo'</em> must allow <em>`j foo'</em> and
<em>`jal foo'</em> to be executed speculatively.  GCC honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC
functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do the same.</p>

<p>The option has three forms:</p>
        <dl><dt>-mr10k-cache-barrier=load-store</dt><dd>

Insert a cache barrier before a load or store that might be
speculatively executed and that might have side effects even
if aborted.
          </dd><dt>-mr10k-cache-barrier=store</dt><dd>

Insert a cache barrier before a store that might be speculatively
executed and that might have side effects even if aborted.
          </dd><dt>-mr10k-cache-barrier=none</dt><dd>

Disable the insertion of cache barriers.  This is the default setting.
          </dd></dl>
         
      </dd><dt>-mflush-func=<em><code>func</code></em></dt>


      <dt>-mno-flush-func</dt><dd>


Specifies the function to call to flush the I and D caches, or to not
call any such function.  If called, the function must take the same
arguments as the common <em>`_flush_func()'</em>, that is, the address of the
memory range for which the cache is being flushed, the size of the
memory range, and the number 3 (to flush both caches).  The default
depends on the target GCC was configured for, but commonly is either
<em>_flush_func</em> or <em>_ _cpu_flush</em>.
      </dd><dt><em>mbranch-cost=</em><em>num</em></dt><dd>

Set the cost of branches to roughly <em>num</em> “simple” instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.  A zero cost redundantly selects
the default, which is based on the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mtune">-mtune</a></span> setting.
      </dd><dt>-mbranch-likely</dt>


      <dt>-mno-branch-likely</dt><dd>


Enable or disable use of Branch Likely instructions, regardless of the
default for the selected architecture.  By default, Branch Likely
instructions may be generated if they are supported by the selected
architecture.  An exception is for the MIPS32 and MIPS64 architectures
and processors that implement those architectures; for those, Branch
Likely instructions are not be generated by default because the MIPS32
and MIPS64 architectures specifically deprecate their use.
      </dd><dt>-mfp-exceptions</dt>


      <dt>-mno-fp-exceptions</dt><dd>


Specifies whether FP exceptions are enabled.  This affects how
FP instructions are scheduled for some processors.
The default is that FP exceptions are
enabled.

<p>For instance, on the SB-1, if FP exceptions are disabled, and we are emitting
64-bit code, then we can use both FP pipes.  Otherwise, we can only use one
FP pipe.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mvr4130-align</dt>


      <dt>-mno-vr4130-align</dt><dd>


The VR4130 pipeline is two-way superscalar, but can only issue two
instructions together if the first one is 8-byte aligned.  When this
option is enabled, GCC aligns pairs of instructions that it
thinks should execute in parallel.

<p>This option only has an effect when optimizing for the VR4130.
It normally makes code faster, but at the expense of making it bigger.
It is enabled by default at optimization level <span class="option">-O3</span>.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msynci</dt>


      <dt>-mno-synci</dt><dd>


Enable (disable) generation of <em>`synci'</em> instructions on
architectures that support it.  The <em>`synci'</em> instructions (if
enabled) are generated when <em>`_ _builtin_ _ _clear_cache()'</em> is
compiled.

<p>This option defaults to <em>`-mno-synci'</em>, but the default can be
overridden by configuring with <em>`--with-synci'</em>.</p>

<p>When compiling code for single processor systems, it is generally safe
to use <em>`synci'</em>.  However, on many multi-core (SMP) systems, it
does not invalidate the instruction caches on all cores and may lead
to undefined behavior.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mrelax-pic-calls</dt>


      <dt>-mno-relax-pic-calls</dt><dd>


Try to turn PIC calls that are normally dispatched via register
<em>$25</em> into direct calls.  This is only possible if the linker can
resolve the destination at link-time and if the destination is within
range for a direct call.

<p><span class="option">-mrelax-pic-calls</span> is the default if GCC was configured to use
an assembler and a linker that support the <em>`.reloc'</em> assembly
directive and <em>`-mexplicit-relocs'</em> is in effect.  With
<em>`-mno-explicit-relocs'</em>, this optimization can be performed by the
assembler and the linker alone without help from the compiler.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mmcount-ra-address</dt>


      <dt>-mno-mcount-ra-address</dt><dd>


Emit (do not emit) code that allows <em>`_mcount'</em> to modify the
calling function's return address.  When enabled, this option extends
the usual <em>`_mcount'</em> interface with a new <em>ra-address</em>
parameter, which has type <em>`intptr_t *'</em> and is passed in register
<em>$12</em>.  <em>`_mcount'</em> can then modify the return address by
doing both of the following:
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle; "><li>
<p>Returning the new address in register <em>$31</em>.</p>
          </li><li>
<p>Storing the new address in <em>`*</em><em>ra-address</em><em>'</em>,
if <em>ra-address</em> is nonnull.</p>
          </li></ul>
      

<p>The default is <span class="option">-mno-mcount-ra-address</span>.
        </p> 
      </dd><dt>-mno-compact-eh</dt>


      <dt>-mcompact-eh</dt><dd>


Disable generation of compact EH frame tables.
<span class="option">-mcompact-eh</span> is the default where supported.

      </dd><dt>-mknuthdiv</dt>


      <dt>-mno-knuthdiv</dt><dd>


Make the result of a division yielding a remainder have the same sign as

Use (do not use) the probable-branch instructions, when static branch
prediction indicates a probable branch.
      </dd><dt>-mbase-addresses</dt>


      <dt>-mno-base-addresses</dt><dd>


Generate (do not generate) code that uses <em>base addresses</em>.  Using a
base address automatically generates a request (handled by the assembler
and the linker) for a constant to be set up in a global register.  The
register is used for one or more base address requests within the range 0
to 255 from the value held in the register.  The generally leads to short
and fast code, but the number of different data items that can be
addressed is limited.  This means that a program that uses lots of static
data may require <span class="option">-mno-base-addresses</span>.

When generating a function that returns a pointer, return the pointer
in both <em>`a0'</em> and <em>`d0'</em>.  Otherwise, the pointer is returned

<p><em>picoChip Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for picoChip implementations:</p>
      </dd><dt>-mae=<em><code>ae_type</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
parameters for array element type <em>ae_type</em>.  Supported values
for <em>ae_type</em> are <em>ANY</em>, <em>MUL</em>, and <em>MAC</em>.

<p><span class="option">-mae=ANY</span> selects a completely generic AE type.  Code
generated with this option runs on any of the other AE types.  The
code is not as efficient as it would be if compiled for a specific
AE type, and some types of operation (e.g., multiplication) do not
work properly on all types of AE.</p>

<p><span class="option">-mae=MUL</span> selects a MUL AE type.  This is the most useful AE type
for compiled code, and is the default.</p>

<p><span class="option">-mae=MAC</span> selects a DSP-style MAC AE.  Code compiled with this
option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char) manipulation,
since the DSP AE does not provide hardware support for byte load/stores.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msymbol-as-address</dt><dd>

Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an address in a
load/store instruction, without first loading it into a
register.  Typically, the use of this option generates larger
programs, which run faster than when the option isn't used.  However, the
results vary from program to program, so it is left as a user option,
rather than being permanently enabled.
      </dd><dt>-mno-inefficient-warnings</dt><dd>

Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.  These
warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code that
performs byte-level memory operations on the MAC AE type.  The MAC AE has
no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all byte
load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is
inefficient and a warning is generated to indicate
that you should rewrite the code to avoid byte operations, or to target
an AE type that has the necessary hardware support.  This option disables
these warnings.

<p><em>PowerPC Options</em>

You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
processor you are using.  The default value of these options is
determined when configuring GCC.  Specifying the
<span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=</span><em><code>cpu_type</code></em> overrides the specification of these
options.  We recommend you use the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=</span><em><code>cpu_type</code></em> option
rather than the options listed above.

<p>Specifying <span class="option">-mpowerpc-gpopt</span> allows
GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
General Purpose group, including floating-point square root.  Specifying
<span class="option">-mpowerpc-gfxopt</span> allows GCC to
use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the Graphics
group, including floating-point select.</p>

<p>The <span class="option">-mmfcrf</span> option allows GCC to generate the move from
condition register field instruction implemented on the POWER4
processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01
architecture.
The <span class="option">-mpopcntb</span> option allows GCC to generate the popcount and
double-precision FP reciprocal estimate instruction implemented on the
POWER5 processor and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.02
architecture.
The <span class="option">-mpopcntd</span> option allows GCC to generate the popcount
instruction implemented on the POWER7 processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC V2.06 architecture.
The <span class="option">-mfprnd</span> option allows GCC to generate the FP round to
integer instructions implemented on the POWER5+ processor and other
processors that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture.
The <span class="option">-mcmpb</span> option allows GCC to generate the compare bytes
instruction implemented on the POWER6 processor and other processors
that support the PowerPC V2.05 architecture.
The <span class="option">-mmfpgpr</span> option allows GCC to generate the FP move to/from
general-purpose register instructions implemented on the POWER6X
processor and other processors that support the extended PowerPC V2.05
architecture.
The <span class="option">-mhard-dfp</span> option allows GCC to generate the decimal
floating-point instructions implemented on some POWER processors.</p>

<p>The <span class="option">-mpowerpc64</span> option allows GCC to generate the additional
64-bit instructions that are found in the full PowerPC64 architecture
and to treat GPRs as 64-bit, doubleword quantities.  GCC defaults to

<p>The particular options set for any particular CPU varies between

      </dd><dt>-m32</dt>


      <dt>-m64</dt><dd>


Generate code for 32-bit or 64-bit environments of Darwin and SVR4
targets (including GNU/Linux).  The 32-bit environment sets int, long
and pointer to 32 bits and generates code that runs on any PowerPC
variant.  The 64-bit environment sets int to 32 bits and long and
pointer to 64 bits, and generates code for PowerPC64, as for
<span class="option">-mpowerpc64</span>.

      <dt>-mno-fp-in-toc</dt>

      <dt>-mno-sum-in-toc</dt>

      <dt>-mminimal-toc</dt><dd>


Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created for
every executable file.  The <span class="option">-mfull-toc</span> option is selected by
default.  In that case, GCC allocates at least one TOC entry for
each unique non-automatic variable reference in your program.  GCC
also places floating-point constants in the TOC.  However, only
16,384 entries are available in the TOC.

<p>If you receive a linker error message that saying you have overflowed
the available TOC space, you can reduce the amount of TOC space used
with the <span class="option">-mno-fp-in-toc</span> and <span class="option">-mno-sum-in-toc</span> options.
<span class="option">-mno-fp-in-toc</span> prevents GCC from putting floating-point
constants in the TOC and <span class="option">-mno-sum-in-toc</span> forces GCC to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at
run time instead of putting that sum into the TOC.  You may specify one
or both of these options.  Each causes GCC to produce very slightly
slower and larger code at the expense of conserving TOC space.</p>

<p>If you still run out of space in the TOC even when you specify both of
these options, specify <span class="option">-mminimal-toc</span> instead.  This option causes
GCC to make only one TOC entry for every file.  When you specify this
option, GCC produces code that is slower and larger but which
uses extremely little TOC space.  You may wish to use this option
only on files that contain less frequently-executed code.</p>

      <dt>-maix32</dt><dd>


Enable 64-bit AIX ABI and calling convention: 64-bit pointers, 64-bit
<em>`long'</em> type, and the infrastructure needed to support them.
Specifying <span class="option">-maix64</span> implies <span class="option">-mpowerpc64</span>,
while <span class="option">-maix32</span> disables the 64-bit ABI and
implies <span class="option">-mno-powerpc64</span>.  GCC defaults to <span class="option">-maix32</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mxl-compat</dt>


      <dt>-mno-xl-compat</dt><dd>


Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler semantics
when using AIX-compatible ABI.  Pass floating-point arguments to
prototyped functions beyond the register save area (RSA) on the stack
in addition to argument FPRs.  Do not assume that most significant
double in 128-bit long double value is properly rounded when comparing
values and converting to double.  Use XL symbol names for long double
support routines.

<p>The AIX calling convention was extended but not initially documented to
handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a function that takes the
address of its arguments with fewer arguments than declared.  IBM XL
compilers access floating-point arguments that do not fit in the
RSA from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
optimization.  Because always storing floating-point arguments on the
stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
default and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by IBM
XL compilers without optimization.</p>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the load or store instructions
that update the base register to the address of the calculated memory
location.  These instructions are generated by default.  If you use
<span class="option">-mno-update</span>, there is a small window between the time that the

      <dt>-mno-longcall</dt><dd>


By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and more
expensive calling sequence is required.  This is required for calls
farther than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location.
A short call is generated if the compiler knows
the call cannot be that far away.  This setting can be overridden by
the <em>`shortcall'</em> function attribute, or by `#pragma
longcall(0)'.

<p>Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and generating
glue code on the fly.  On these systems, long calls are unnecessary and
generate slower code.  As of this writing, the AIX linker can do this,
as can the GNU linker for PowerPC/64.  It is planned to add this feature
to the GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.</p>

<p>On Darwin/PPC systems, <em>`#pragma longcall'</em> generates <em>`jbsr
callee, L42'</em>, plus a <em>branch island</em> (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the branch island.  The
Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and generates a <em>`bl
callee'</em> if the PPC <em>`bl'</em> instruction reaches the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker generates <em>`bl L42'</em> to call the branch
island.  The branch island is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.</p>

<p>On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.</p>

<p>In the future, GCC may ignore all longcall specifications
when the linker is known to generate glue.</p>

This option enables use of the reciprocal estimate and
reciprocal square root estimate instructions with additional
Newton-Raphson steps to increase precision instead of doing a divide or
square root and divide for floating-point arguments.  You should use

<span class="option">-fno-trapping-math</span>).  Note that while the throughput of the
sequence is generally higher than the throughput of the non-reciprocal
instruction, the precision of the sequence can be decreased by up to 2
ulp (i.e. the inverse of 1.0 equals 0.99999994) for reciprocal square
roots.
      </dd><dt>-mrecip=<em><code>opt</code></em></dt><dd>

This option controls which reciprocal estimate instructions
may be used.  <em>opt</em> is a comma-separated list of options, which may
be preceded by a <em>`!'</em> to invert the option:
<em>`all'</em>: enable all estimate instructions,
<em>`default'</em>: enable the default instructions, equivalent to <span class="option">-mrecip</span>,
<em>`none'</em>: disable all estimate instructions, equivalent to <span class="option">-mno-recip</span>;
<em>`div'</em>: enable the reciprocal approximation instructions for both single and double precision;
<em>`divf'</em>: enable the single-precision reciprocal approximation instructions;
<em>`divd'</em>: enable the double-precision reciprocal approximation instructions;
<em>`rsqrt'</em>: enable the reciprocal square root approximation instructions for both single and double precision;
<em>`rsqrtf'</em>: enable the single-precision reciprocal square root approximation instructions;
<em>`rsqrtd'</em>: enable the double-precision reciprocal square root approximation instructions;

<p>So, for example, <span class="option">-mrecip=all,!rsqrtd</span> enables
all of the reciprocal estimate instructions, except for the
<em>`FRSQRTE'</em>, <em>`XSRSQRTEDP'</em>, and <em>`XVRSQRTEDP'</em> instructions
which handle the double-precision reciprocal square root calculations.</p>

      </dd><dt>-msmall-data-limit=<em><code>N</code></em></dt><dd>

Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the RX's
registers (usually <em>`r13'</em>) is reserved for use pointing to this
area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed onto
the stack instead of being held in this register.

<p>Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized) and
constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned
to other sections in the output executable.</p>

<p>The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
(<span class="option">-O2</span> etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and
discover whether this feature is of benefit to their program.  See the
description of the <span class="option">-mpid</span> option for a description of how the
actual register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.</p>
      </dd><dt>-msim</dt>


      <dt>-mno-sim</dt><dd>


Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss
board-specific runtime.
      </dd><dt>-mas100-syntax</dt>


      <dt>-mno-as100-syntax</dt><dd>


When generating assembler output use a syntax that is compatible with
Renesas's AS100 assembler.  This syntax can also be handled by the GAS
assembler, but it has some restrictions so it is not generated by default.
      </dd><dt>-mmax-constant-size=<em><code>N</code></em></dt><dd>

Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as
an operand in a RX instruction.  Although the RX instruction set does
allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions,
a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some
circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants
that are used in instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead
placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.

<p>The value <em>N</em> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default)
or 4 means that constants of any size are allowed.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mrelax</dt><dd>

Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby the
linker attempts to reduce the size of a program by finding shorter
versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.
      </dd><dt>-mint-register=<em><code>N</code></em></dt><dd>

Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler
functions.  The value <em>N</em> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1
means that register <em>`r13'</em> is reserved for the exclusive use
of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves <em>`r13'</em> and
<em>`r12'</em>.  A value of 3 reserves <em>`r13'</em>, <em>`r12'</em> and
<em>`r11'</em>, and a value of 4 reserves <em>`r13'</em> through <em>`r10'</em>.
A value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.
      </dd><dt>-msave-acc-in-interrupts</dt><dd>

Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64-bit
multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator as this
makes the interrupt handlers faster.
      </dd><dt>-mpid</dt>


      <dt>-mno-pid</dt><dd>


Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled any
access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address
held in a register.  This allows the location of constant data to be
determined at run time without requiring the executable to be
relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight
memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by this
option.

<p>Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually <em>`r13'</em>, for
the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated functions.</p>

<p>The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address
depends upon whether the <span class="option">-msmall-data-limit</span> and/or the
<span class="option">-mint-register</span> command-line options are enabled.  Starting
with register <em>`r13'</em> and proceeding downwards, registers are
allocated first to satisfy the requirements of <span class="option">-mint-register</span>,
then <span class="option">-mpid</span> and finally <span class="option">-msmall-data-limit</span>.  Thus it
is possible for the small data area register to be <em>`r8'</em> if both
<span class="option">-mint-register=4</span> and <span class="option">-mpid</span> are specified on the
command line.</p>

<p>By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be restored
via the <span class="option">-mno-pid</span> command-line option.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts</dt>


      <dt>-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts</dt><dd>


Prevents GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more than one
fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.  The default is to
issue a warning for each extra fast interrupt handler found, as the RX
only supports one such interrupt.

<p><em>Note:</em> The generic GCC command-line option <span class="option">-ffixed-</span><em><code>reg</code></em>
has special significance to the RX port when used with the
<em>`interrupt'</em> function attribute.  This attribute indicates a
function intended to process fast interrupts.  GCC ensures
that it only uses the registers <em>`r10'</em>, <em>`r11'</em>, <em>`r12'</em>
and/or <em>`r13'</em> and only provided that the normal use of the
corresponding registers have been restricted via the
<span class="option">-ffixed-</span><em><code>reg</code></em> or <span class="option">-mint-register</span> command-line
options.</p>

<p><em>S/390 and zSeries Options</em>

      </dd><dt>-mhard-float</dt>


      <dt>-msoft-float</dt><dd>


Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions and registers
for floating-point operations.  When <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> is specified,
functions in <em>libgcc.a</em> are used to perform floating-point
operations.  When <span class="option">-mhard-float</span> is specified, the compiler
generates IEEE floating-point instructions.  This is the default.
      </dd><dt>-mhard-dfp</dt>


      <dt>-mno-hard-dfp</dt><dd>


Use (do not use) the hardware decimal-floating-point instructions for
decimal-floating-point operations.  When <span class="option">-mno-hard-dfp</span> is
specified, functions in <em>libgcc.a</em> are used to perform
decimal-floating-point operations.  When <span class="option">-mhard-dfp</span> is
specified, the compiler generates decimal-floating-point hardware
instructions.  This is the default for <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-march">-march</a>=z9-ec</span> or higher.
      </dd><dt>-mlong-double-64</dt>


      <dt>-mlong-double-128</dt><dd>


These switches control the size of <em>`long double'</em> type. A size
of 64 bits makes the <em>`long double'</em> type equivalent to the <em>`double'</em>
type. This is the default.
      </dd><dt>-mbackchain</dt>


      <dt>-mno-backchain</dt><dd>


Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer
into the callee's stack frame.
A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand
DWARF 2 call frame information.
When <span class="option">-mno-packed-stack</span> is in effect, the backchain pointer is stored
at the bottom of the stack frame; when <span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span> is in effect,
the backchain is placed into the topmost word of the 96/160 byte register
save area.

<p>In general, code compiled with <span class="option">-mbackchain</span> is call-compatible with
code compiled with <span class="option">-mmo-backchain</span>; however, use of the backchain
for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole binary is built with
<span class="option">-mbackchain</span>.  Note that the combination of <span class="option">-mbackchain</span>,
<span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span> and <span class="option">-mhard-float</span> is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use <span class="option">-msoft-float</span>.</p>

<p>The default is to not maintain the backchain.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mpacked-stack</dt>


      <dt>-mno-packed-stack</dt><dd>


Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When <span class="option">-mno-packed-stack</span> is
specified, the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte register save
area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space.
When <span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span> is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space.
However, when <span class="option">-mbackchain</span> is also in effect, the topmost word of
the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.

<p>As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with
<span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span> is call-compatible with code generated with
<span class="option">-mno-packed-stack</span>.  Note that some non-FSF releases of GCC 2.95 for
S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run
time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible
with code compiled with <span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span>.  Also, note that the
combination of <span class="option">-mbackchain</span>,
<span class="option">-mpacked-stack</span> and <span class="option">-mhard-float</span> is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use <span class="option">-msoft-float</span>.</p>

<p>The default is to not use the packed stack layout.</p>

Generate (or do not generate) code using the <em>`bras'</em> instruction
to do subroutine calls.
This only works reliably if the total executable size does not

When <span class="option">-m31</span> is specified, generate code compliant to the
GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI.  When <span class="option">-m64</span> is specified, generate
code compliant to the GNU/Linux for zSeries ABI.  This allows GCC in
particular to generate 64-bit instructions.  For the <em>s390</em>
targets, the default is <span class="option">-m31</span>, while the <em>s390x</em>
targets default to <span class="option">-m64</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mzarch</dt>

When <span class="option">-mesa</span> is specified, generate code using the
instructions available on ESA/390.  Note that <span class="option">-mesa</span> is
not possible with <span class="option">-m64</span>.
When generating code compliant to the GNU/Linux for S/390 ABI,

when compiling for the TPF OS.
      </dd><dt>-mfused-madd</dt>

Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply and
accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default if
hardware floating point is used.
      </dd><dt>-mwarn-framesize=<em><code>framesize</code></em></dt><dd>

Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given frame size.  Because
this is a compile-time check it doesn't need to be a real problem when the program
runs.  It is intended to identify functions that most probably cause
a stack overflow.  It is useful to be used in an environment with limited stack
size e.g. the linux kernel.
      </dd><dt>-mwarn-dynamicstack</dt><dd>

Emit a warning if the function calls <em>`alloca'</em> or uses dynamically-sized
arrays.  This is generally a bad idea with a limited stack size.
      </dd><dt>-mstack-guard=<em><code>stack-guard</code></em></dt>


      <dt>-mstack-size=<em><code>stack-size</code></em></dt><dd>


If these options are provided the S/390 back end emits additional instructions in
the function prologue that trigger a trap if the stack size is <em>stack-guard</em>
bytes above the <em>stack-size</em> (remember that the stack on S/390 grows downward).
If the <em>stack-guard</em> option is omitted the smallest power of 2 larger than
the frame size of the compiled function is chosen.
These options are intended to be used to help debugging stack overflow problems.
The additionally emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can also be
used in production-like systems without greater performance degradation.  The given
values have to be exact powers of 2 and <em>stack-size</em> has to be greater than
<em>stack-guard</em> without exceeding 64k.
In order to be efficient the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts
at an address aligned to the value given by <em>stack-size</em>.
The <em>stack-guard</em> option can only be used in conjunction with <em>stack-size</em>.

The funtion label is prepended with the given number of two-byte
Nop instructions (<em>halfwords</em>, maximum 1000000) or 12 Nop
instructions if no argument is present.  Functions with a
hot-patching prologue are never inlined automatically, and a

      <dt>-mno-ieee</dt><dd>


Control the IEEE compliance of floating-point comparisons, which affects the

<span class="option">-mieee</span> is implicitly enabled.  If <span class="option">-ffinite-math-only</span> is
enabled <span class="option">-mno-ieee</span> is implicitly set, which results in faster
floating-point greater-equal and less-equal comparisons.  The implcit settings
can be overridden by specifying either <span class="option">-mieee</span> or <span class="option">-mno-ieee</span>.
      </dd><dt>-minline-ic_invalidate</dt><dd>

Inline code to invalidate instruction cache entries after setting up
nested function trampolines.
This option has no effect if <span class="option">-musermode</span> is in effect and the selected
code generation option (e.g. <span class="option">-m4</span>) does not allow the use of the <em>`icbi'</em>
instruction.
If the selected code generation option does not allow the use of the <em>`icbi'</em>
instruction, and <span class="option">-musermode</span> is not in effect, the inlined code
manipulates the instruction cache address array directly with an associative
write.  This not only requires privileged mode at run time, but it also
fails if the cache line had been mapped via the TLB and has become unmapped.
      </dd><dt>-misize</dt><dd>

Dump instruction size and location in the assembly code.
      </dd><dt>-mpadstruct</dt><dd>

This option is deprecated.  It pads structures to multiple of 4 bytes,
which is incompatible with the SH ABI.
      </dd><dt>-matomic-model=<em><code>model</code></em></dt><dd>

Sets the model of atomic operations and additional parameters as a comma
separated list.  For details on the atomic built-in functions see
<em>_ _atomic Builtins</em>.  The following models and parameters are supported:
        <dl><dt><em>none</em></dt><dd>

Disable compiler generated atomic sequences and emit library calls for atomic
operations.  This is the default if the target is not <em>`sh-*-linux*'</em>.
          </dd><dt><em>soft-gusa</em></dt><dd>

Generate GNU/Linux compatible gUSA software atomic sequences for the atomic
built-in functions.  The generated atomic sequences require additional support
from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only suitable
for SH3* and SH4* single-core systems.  This option is enabled by default when
the target is <em>`sh-*-linux*'</em> and SH3* or SH4*.  When the target is SH4A,
this option will also partially utilize the hardware atomic instructions
<em>`movli.l'</em> and <em>`movco.l'</em> to create more efficient code, unless
<em>strict</em> is specified.
          </dd><dt><em>soft-tcb</em></dt><dd>

Generate software atomic sequences that use a variable in the thread control
block.  This is a variation of the gUSA sequences which can also be used on
SH1* and SH2* targets.  The generated atomic sequences require additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system and are only
suitable for single-core systems.  When using this model, the <em>gbr-offset=</em>
parameter has to be specified as well.
          </dd><dt><em>soft-imask</em></dt><dd>

Generate software atomic sequences that temporarily disable interrupts by
setting <em>`SR.IMASK = 1111'</em>.  This model works only when the program runs
in privileged mode and is only suitable for single-core systems.  Additional
support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the system is not
required.  This model is enabled by default when the target is
<em>`sh-*-linux*'</em> and SH1* or SH2*.
          </dd><dt><em>hard-llcs</em></dt><dd>

Generate hardware atomic sequences using the <em>`movli.l'</em> and <em>`movco.l'</em>
instructions only.  This is only available on SH4A and is suitable for
multi-core systems.  Since the hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic
variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses.
Code compiled with this option will also be compatible with other software
atomic model interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an SH4A
system.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the
system is not required for this model.
          </dd><dt><em>gbr-offset=</em></dt><dd>

This parameter specifies the offset in bytes of the variable in the thread
control block structure that should be used by the generated atomic sequences
when the <em>soft-tcb</em> model has been selected.  For other models this
parameter is ignored.  The specified value must be an integer multiple of four
and in the range 0-1020.
          </dd><dt><em>strict</em></dt><dd>

This parameter prevents mixed usage of multiple atomic models, even though they
would be compatible, and will make the compiler generate atomic sequences of the
specified model only.
          </dd></dl>

      </dd><dt>-mtas</dt><dd>

Generate the <em>`tas.b'</em> opcode for <em>`_ _atomic_test_and_set'</em>.
Notice that depending on the particular hardware and software configuration
this can degrade overall performance due to the operand cache line flushes
that are implied by the <em>`tas.b'</em> instruction.  On multi-core SH4A
processors the <em>`tas.b'</em> instruction must be used with caution since it
can result in data corruption for certain cache configurations.
      </dd><dt>-mspace</dt><dd>

Optimize for space instead of speed.  Implied by <span class="option">-Os</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mprefergot</dt><dd>

When generating position-independent code, emit function calls using
the Global Offset Table instead of the Procedure Linkage Table.
      </dd><dt>-musermode</dt><dd>

Don't generate privileged mode only code.  This option
implies <span class="option">-mno-inline-ic_invalidate</span>
if the inlined code would not work in user mode.
This is the default when the target is <em>`sh-*-linux*'</em>.
      </dd><dt>-multcost=<em><code>number</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the cost to assume for a multiply insn.
      </dd><dt>-mdiv=<em><code>strategy</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the division strategy to be used for integer division operations.
For SHmedia <em>strategy</em> can be one of:
        <dl><dt><em>fp</em></dt><dd>

Performs the operation in floating point.  This has a very high latency,
but needs only a few instructions, so it might be a good choice if
your code has enough easily-exploitable ILP to allow the compiler to
schedule the floating-point instructions together with other instructions.
Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.
          </dd><dt><em>inv</em></dt><dd>

Uses integer operations to calculate the inverse of the divisor,
and then multiplies the dividend with the inverse.  This strategy allows
CSE and hoisting of the inverse calculation.  Division by zero calculates
an unspecified result, but does not trap.
          </dd><dt><em>inv:minlat</em></dt><dd>

A variant of <em>inv</em> where, if no CSE or hoisting opportunities
have been found, or if the entire operation has been hoisted to the same
place, the last stages of the inverse calculation are intertwined with the
final multiply to reduce the overall latency, at the expense of using a few
more instructions, and thus offering fewer scheduling opportunities with
other code.
          </dd><dt><em>call</em></dt><dd>

Calls a library function that usually implements the <em>inv:minlat</em>
strategy.
This gives high code density for <em>`m5-*media-nofpu'</em> compilations.
          </dd><dt><em>call2</em></dt><dd>

Uses a different entry point of the same library function, where it
assumes that a pointer to a lookup table has already been set up, which
exposes the pointer load to CSE and code hoisting optimizations.
          </dd><dt><em>inv:call</em></dt>


          <dt><em>inv:call2</em></dt>

          <dt><em>inv:fp</em></dt><dd>


Use the <em>inv</em> algorithm for initial
code generation, but if the code stays unoptimized, revert to the <em>call</em>,
<em>call2</em>, or <em>fp</em> strategies, respectively.  Note that the
potentially-trapping side effect of division by zero is carried by a
separate instruction, so it is possible that all the integer instructions
are hoisted out, but the marker for the side effect stays where it is.
A recombination to floating-point operations or a call is not possible
in that case.
          </dd><dt><em>inv20u</em></dt>


          <dt><em>inv20l</em></dt><dd>


Variants of the <em>inv:minlat</em> strategy.  In the case
that the inverse calculation is not separated from the multiply, they speed
up division where the dividend fits into 20 bits (plus sign where applicable)
by inserting a test to skip a number of operations in this case; this test
slows down the case of larger dividends.  <em>inv20u</em> assumes the case of a such
a small dividend to be unlikely, and <em>inv20l</em> assumes it to be likely.
          </dd></dl>
      

<p>For targets other than SHmedia <em>strategy</em> can be one of:</p>
        <dl><dt><em>call-div1</em></dt><dd>

Calls a library function that uses the single-step division instruction
<em>`div1'</em> to perform the operation.  Division by zero calculates an
unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the default except for SH4,
SH2A and SHcompact.
          </dd><dt><em>call-fp</em></dt><dd>

Calls a library function that performs the operation in double precision
floating point.  Division by zero causes a floating-point exception.  This is
the default for SHcompact with FPU.  Specifying this for targets that do not
have a double precision FPU will default to <em>`call-div1'</em>.
          </dd><dt><em>call-table</em></dt><dd>

Calls a library function that uses a lookup table for small divisors and
the <em>`div1'</em> instruction with case distinction for larger divisors.  Division
by zero calculates an unspecified result and does not trap.  This is the default
for SH4.  Specifying this for targets that do not have dynamic shift
instructions will default to <em>`call-div1'</em>.
          </dd></dl>
         
      

<p>When a division strategy has not been specified the default strategy will be
selected based on the current target.  For SH2A the default strategy is to
use the <em>`divs'</em> and <em>`divu'</em> instructions instead of library function
calls.
        </p> 
      </dd><dt>-maccumulate-outgoing-args</dt><dd>

Reserve space once for outgoing arguments in the function prologue rather
than around each call.  Generally beneficial for performance and size.  Also
needed for unwinding to avoid changing the stack frame around conditional code.
      </dd><dt>-mdivsi3_libfunc=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the name of the library function used for 32-bit signed division to
<em>name</em>.
This only affects the name used in the <em>call</em> and <em>inv:call</em>
division strategies, and the compiler still expects the same
sets of input/output/clobbered registers as if this option were not present.
      </dd><dt>-mfixed-range=<em><code>register-range</code></em></dt><dd>

Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator can not use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
      </dd><dt>-mindexed-addressing</dt><dd>

Enable the use of the indexed addressing mode for SHmedia32/SHcompact.
This is only safe if the hardware and/or OS implement 32-bit wrap-around
semantics for the indexed addressing mode.  The architecture allows the
implementation of processors with 64-bit MMU, which the OS could use to
get 32-bit addressing, but since no current hardware implementation supports
this or any other way to make the indexed addressing mode safe to use in
the 32-bit ABI, the default is <span class="option">-mno-indexed-addressing</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mgettrcost=<em><code>number</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the cost assumed for the <em>`gettr'</em> instruction to <em>number</em>.
The default is 2 if <span class="option">-mpt-fixed</span> is in effect, 100 otherwise.
      </dd><dt>-mpt-fixed</dt><dd>

Assume <em>`pt*'</em> instructions won't trap.  This generally generates
better-scheduled code, but is unsafe on current hardware.
The current architecture
definition says that <em>`ptabs'</em> and <em>`ptrel'</em> trap when the target 
anded with 3 is 3.
This has the unintentional effect of making it unsafe to schedule these
instructions before a branch, or hoist them out of a loop.  For example,
<em>`_ _do_global_ctors'</em>, a part of <em>libgcc</em>
that runs constructors at program
startup, calls functions in a list which is delimited by -1.  With the
<span class="option">-mpt-fixed</span> option, the <em>`ptabs'</em> is done before testing against -1.
That means that all the constructors run a bit more quickly, but when
the loop comes to the end of the list, the program crashes because <em>`ptabs'</em>
loads -1 into a target register.

<p>Since this option is unsafe for any
hardware implementing the current architecture specification, the default
is <span class="option">-mno-pt-fixed</span>.  Unless specified explicitly with 
<span class="option">-mgettrcost</span>, <span class="option">-mno-pt-fixed</span> also implies <span class="option">-mgettrcost=100</span>;
this deters register allocation from using target registers for storing
ordinary integers.</p>
      </dd><dt>-minvalid-symbols</dt><dd>

Assume symbols might be invalid.  Ordinary function symbols generated by
the compiler are always valid to load with
<em>`movi'</em>/<em>`shori'</em>/<em>`ptabs'</em> or
<em>`movi'</em>/<em>`shori'</em>/<em>`ptrel'</em>,
but with assembler and/or linker tricks it is possible
to generate symbols that cause <em>`ptabs'</em> or <em>`ptrel'</em> to trap.
This option is only meaningful when <span class="option">-mno-pt-fixed</span> is in effect.
It prevents cross-basic-block CSE, hoisting and most scheduling
of symbol loads.  The default is <span class="option">-mno-invalid-symbols</span>.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mbranch-cost">-mbranch-cost</a>=<em><code>num</code></em></dt><dd>

Assume <em>num</em> to be the cost for a branch instruction.  Higher numbers
make the compiler try to generate more branch-free code if possible.  
If not specified the value is selected depending on the processor type that
is being compiled for.
      </dd><dt>-mzdcbranch</dt>


      <dt>-mno-zdcbranch</dt><dd>


Assume (do not assume) that zero displacement conditional branch instructions
<em>`bt'</em> and <em>`bf'</em> are fast.  If <span class="option">-mzdcbranch</span> is specified, the
compiler will try to prefer zero displacement branch code sequences.  This is
enabled by default when generating code for SH4 and SH4A.  It can be explicitly
disabled by specifying <span class="option">-mno-zdcbranch</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mcbranchdi</dt><dd>

Enable the <em>`cbranchdi4'</em> instruction pattern.
      </dd><dt>-mcmpeqdi</dt><dd>

Emit the <em>`cmpeqdi_t'</em> instruction pattern even when <span class="option">-mcbranchdi</span>
is in effect.
      </dd><dt>-mfused-madd</dt>


      <dt>-mno-fused-madd</dt><dd>


Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point multiply and
accumulate instructions.  These instructions are generated by default
if hardware floating point is used.  The machine-dependent
<span class="option">-mfused-madd</span> option is now mapped to the machine-independent
<span class="option">-ffp-contract=fast</span> option, and <span class="option">-mno-fused-madd</span> is
mapped to <span class="option">-ffp-contract=off</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mfsca</dt>


      <dt>-mno-fsca</dt><dd>


Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the <em>`fsca'</em> instruction for sine
and cosine approximations.  The option <em>`-mfsca'</em> must be used in
combination with <em>`-funsafe-math-optimizations'</em>.  It is enabled by default
when generating code for SH4A.  Using <em>`-mno-fsca'</em> disables sine and cosine
approximations even if <em>`-funsafe-math-optimizations'</em> is in effect.
      </dd><dt>-mfsrra</dt>


      <dt>-mno-fsrra</dt><dd>


Allow or disallow the compiler to emit the <em>`fsrra'</em> instruction for
reciprocal square root approximations.  The option <em>`-mfsrra'</em> must be used
in combination with <em>`-funsafe-math-optimizations'</em> and
<em>`-ffinite-math-only'</em>.  It is enabled by default when generating code for
SH4A.  Using <em>`-mno-fsrra'</em> disables reciprocal square root approximations
even if <em>`-funsafe-math-optimizations'</em> and <em>`-ffinite-math-only'</em> are
in effect.
      </dd><dt>-mpretend-cmove</dt><dd>

Prefer zero-displacement conditional branches for conditional move instruction
patterns.  This can result in faster code on the SH4 processor.

<p><em>Solaris 2 Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are supported on Solaris 2:</p>
      </dd><dt>-mimpure-text</dt><dd>

<span class="option">-mimpure-text</span>, used in addition to <span class="option">-shared</span>, tells
the compiler to not pass <span class="option">-z text</span> to the linker when linking a
shared object.  Using this option, you can link position-dependent
code into a shared object.

<p><span class="option">-mimpure-text</span> suppresses the “relocations remain against
allocatable but non-writable sections” linker error message.
However, the necessary relocations trigger copy-on-write, and the
shared object is not actually shared across processes.  Instead of
using <span class="option">-mimpure-text</span>, you should compile all source code with
<span class="option">-fpic</span> or <span class="option">-fPIC</span>.</p>

<p>These switches are supported in addition to the above on Solaris 2:</p>
      </dd><dt>-pthreads</dt><dd>

Add support for multithreading using the POSIX threads library.  This
option sets flags for both the preprocessor and linker.  This option does
not affect the thread safety of object code produced  by the compiler or
that of libraries supplied with it.
      </dd><dt>-pthread</dt><dd>

This is a synonym for <span class="option">-pthreads</span>.

<p><em>SPARC Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are supported on the SPARC:</p>
      </dd><dt>-mno-app-regs</dt>


      <dt>-mapp-regs</dt><dd>


Specify <span class="option">-mapp-regs</span> to generate output using the global registers
2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.  This
is the default.

<p>To be fully SVR4 ABI-compliant at the cost of some performance loss,
specify <span class="option">-mno-app-regs</span>.  You should compile libraries and system
software with this option.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mflat</dt>


      <dt>-mno-flat</dt><dd>


With <span class="option">-mflat</span>, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and uses a “flat” or single register window model.  This model is compatible
with the regular register window model.  The local registers and the input
registers (0--5) are still treated as “call-saved” registers and are
saved on the stack as needed.

<p>With <span class="option">-mno-flat</span> (the default), the compiler generates save/restore
instructions (except for leaf functions).  This is the normal operating mode.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mfpu</dt>


      <dt>-mhard-float</dt><dd>


Generate output containing floating-point instructions.  This is the
default.
      </dd><dt>-mno-fpu</dt>


      <dt>-msoft-float</dt><dd>


Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
<em>Warning:</em> the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.  The embedded targets <em>sparc-*-aout</em> and
<em>sparclite-*-*</em> do provide software floating-point support.

<p><span class="option">-msoft-float</span> changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile <em>all</em> of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile <em>libgcc.a</em>, the
library that comes with GCC, with <span class="option">-msoft-float</span> in order for
this to work.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mhard-quad-float</dt><dd>

Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating-point
instructions.
      </dd><dt>-msoft-quad-float</dt><dd>

Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

<p>As of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the
<span class="option">-msoft-quad-float</span> option is the default.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mno-unaligned-doubles</dt>


      <dt>-munaligned-doubles</dt><dd>


Assume that doubles have 8-byte alignment.  This is the default.

<p>With <span class="option">-munaligned-doubles</span>, GCC assumes that doubles have 8-byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4-byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code
generated by other compilers.  It is not the default because it results
in a performance loss, especially for floating-point code.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mno-faster-structs</dt>


      <dt>-mfaster-structs</dt><dd>


With <span class="option">-mfaster-structs</span>, the compiler assumes that structures
should have 8-byte alignment.  This enables the use of pairs of
<em>`ldd'</em> and <em>`std'</em> instructions for copies in structure
assignment, in place of twice as many <em>`ld'</em> and <em>`st'</em> pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the SPARC
ABI.  Thus, it's intended only for use on targets where the developer
acknowledges that their resulting code is not directly in line with
the rules of the ABI.

size, both starting anywhere in memory (determined at link time).  The
global register <em>%g4</em> points to the base of the data segment.  Programs
are statically linked and PIC is not supported.
          </dd></dl>

        </p> 
      </dd><dt>-mstack-bias</dt>


      <dt>-mno-stack-bias</dt><dd>


With <span class="option">-mstack-bias</span>, GCC assumes that the stack pointer, and
frame pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be added back
when making stack frame references.  This is the default in 64-bit mode.
Otherwise, assume no such offset is present.

<p><em>SPU Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are supported on the SPU:</p>
      </dd><dt>-mwarn-reloc</dt>


      <dt>-merror-reloc</dt><dd>


The loader for SPU does not handle dynamic relocations.  By default, GCC
gives an error when it generates code that requires a dynamic
relocation.  <span class="option">-mno-error-reloc</span> disables the error,
<span class="option">-mwarn-reloc</span> generates a warning instead.
      </dd><dt>-msafe-dma</dt>


      <dt>-munsafe-dma</dt><dd>


Instructions that initiate or test completion of DMA must not be
reordered with respect to loads and stores of the memory that is being
accessed.
With <span class="option">-munsafe-dma</span> you must use the <em>`volatile'</em> keyword to protect
memory accesses, but that can lead to inefficient code in places where the
memory is known to not change.  Rather than mark the memory as volatile,
you can use <span class="option">-msafe-dma</span> to tell the compiler to treat
the DMA instructions as potentially affecting all memory.
      </dd><dt>-mbranch-hints</dt><dd>

By default, GCC generates a branch hint instruction to avoid
pipeline stalls for always-taken or probably-taken branches.  A hint
is not generated closer than 8 instructions away from its branch.
There is little reason to disable them, except for debugging purposes,
or to make an object a little bit smaller.
      </dd><dt>-msmall-mem</dt>


      <dt>-mlarge-mem</dt><dd>


By default, GCC generates code assuming that addresses are never larger
than 18 bits.  With <span class="option">-mlarge-mem</span> code is generated that assumes
a full 32-bit address.
      </dd><dt>-mstdmain</dt><dd>

By default, GCC links against startup code that assumes the SPU-style
main function interface (which has an unconventional parameter list).
With <span class="option">-mstdmain</span>, GCC links your program against startup
code that assumes a C99-style interface to <em>`main'</em>, including a
local copy of <em>`argv'</em> strings.
      </dd><dt>-mfixed-range=<em><code>register-range</code></em></dt><dd>

Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is
useful when compiling kernel code.  A register range is specified as
two registers separated by a dash.  Multiple register ranges can be
specified separated by a comma.
      </dd><dt>-mea32</dt>


      <dt>-mea64</dt><dd>


Compile code assuming that pointers to the PPU address space accessed
via the <em>`_ _ea'</em> named address space qualifier are either 32 or 64
bits wide.  The default is 32 bits.  As this is an ABI-changing option,
all object code in an executable must be compiled with the same setting.
      </dd><dt>-maddress-space-conversion</dt>


      <dt>-mno-address-space-conversion</dt><dd>


Allow/disallow treating the <em>`_ _ea'</em> address space as superset
of the generic address space.  This enables explicit type casts
between <em>`_ _ea'</em> and generic pointer as well as implicit
conversions of generic pointers to <em>`_ _ea'</em> pointers.  The
default is to allow address space pointer conversions.
      </dd><dt>-mcache-size=<em><code>cache-size</code></em></dt><dd>

This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects a software-managed cache for accessing variables
in the <em>`_ _ea'</em> address space with a particular cache size.  Possible
options for <em>cache-size</em> are <code class="literal">8</code>, <code class="literal">16</code>, <code class="literal">32</code>, <code class="literal">64</code>
and <code class="literal">128</code>.  The default cache size is 64KB.
      </dd><dt>-matomic-updates</dt>


      <dt>-mno-atomic-updates</dt><dd>


This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an
executable and selects whether atomic updates to the software-managed
cache of PPU-side variables are used.  If you use atomic updates, changes
to a PPU variable from SPU code using the <em>`_ _ea'</em> named address space
qualifier do not interfere with changes to other PPU variables residing
in the same cache line from PPU code.  If you do not use atomic updates,
such interference may occur; however, writing back cache lines is
more efficient.  The default behavior is to use atomic updates.
      </dd><dt>-mdual-nops</dt>


      <dt>-mdual-nops=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>


By default, GCC inserts nops to increase dual issue when it expects
it to increase performance.  <em>n</em> can be a value from 0 to 10.  A
smaller <em>n</em> inserts fewer nops.  10 is the default, 0 is the
same as <span class="option">-mno-dual-nops</span>.  Disabled with <span class="option">-Os</span>.
      </dd><dt>-mhint-max-nops=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>

Maximum number of nops to insert for a branch hint.  A branch hint must
be at least 8 instructions away from the branch it is affecting.  GCC
inserts up to <em>n</em> nops to enforce this, otherwise it does not
generate the branch hint.
      </dd><dt>-mhint-max-distance=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>

The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint to be within
256 instructions of the branch it is affecting.  By default, GCC makes
sure it is within 125.
      </dd><dt>-msafe-hints</dt><dd>

Work around a hardware bug that causes the SPU to stall indefinitely.
By default, GCC inserts the <em>`hbrp'</em> instruction to make sure
this stall won't happen.

<p><em>Options for System V</em>
</p>

<p>These additional options are available on System V Release 4 for
compatibility with other compilers on those systems:</p>
      </dd><dt>-G</dt><dd>

Create a shared object.
It is recommended that <span class="option">-symbolic</span> or <span class="option">-shared</span> be used instead.
      </dd><dt>-Qy</dt><dd>

Identify the versions of each tool used by the compiler, in a
<em>`.ident'</em> assembler directive in the output.
      </dd><dt>-Qn</dt><dd>

Refrain from adding <em>`.ident'</em> directives to the output file (this is
the default).
      </dd><dt>-YP,<em><code>dirs</code></em></dt><dd>

Search the directories <em>dirs</em>, and no others, for libraries
specified with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-l">-l</a></span>.
      </dd><dt>-Ym,<em><code>dir</code></em></dt><dd>

Look in the directory <em>dir</em> to find the M4 preprocessor.
The assembler uses this option.

<p><em>TILE-Gx Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are supported on the TILE-Gx:</p>
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcmodel">-mcmodel</a>=small</dt><dd>

Generate code for the small model.  The distance for direct calls is
limited to 500M in either direction.  PC-relative addresses are 32
bits.  Absolute addresses support the full address range.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcmodel">-mcmodel</a>=large</dt><dd>

Generate code for the large model.  There is no limitation on call
distance, pc-relative addresses, or absolute addresses.
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only supported
type is <em>tilegx</em>.
      </dd><dt>-m32</dt>


      <dt>-m64</dt><dd>


Generate code for a 32-bit or 64-bit environment.  The 32-bit
environment sets int, long, and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64-bit
environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.

<p><em>TILEPro Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are supported on the TILEPro:</p>
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mcpu">-mcpu</a>=<em><code>name</code></em></dt><dd>

Selects the type of CPU to be targeted.  Currently the only supported
type is <em>tilepro</em>.
      </dd><dt>-m32</dt><dd>

Generate code for a 32-bit environment, which sets int, long, and
pointer to 32 bits.  This is the only supported behavior so the flag
is essentially ignored.

<p><em>V850 Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for V850 implementations:</p>
      </dd><dt><a class="in-doc" href="#-mlong-calls">-mlong-calls</a></dt>


      <dt>-mno-long-calls</dt><dd>


Treat all calls as being far away (near).  If calls are assumed to be
far away, the compiler always loads the function's address into a
register, and calls indirect through the pointer.
      </dd><dt>-mno-ep</dt>


      <dt>-mep</dt><dd>


Do not optimize (do optimize) basic blocks that use the same index
pointer 4 or more times to copy pointer into the <em>`ep'</em> register, and
use the shorter <em>`sld'</em> and <em>`sst'</em> instructions.  The <span class="option">-mep</span>
option is on by default if you optimize.
      </dd><dt>-mno-prolog-function</dt>


      <dt>-mprolog-function</dt><dd>


Do not use (do use) external functions to save and restore registers
at the prologue and epilogue of a function.  The external functions
are slower, but use less code space if more than one function saves
the same number of registers.  The <span class="option">-mprolog-function</span> option
is on by default if you optimize.
      </dd><dt>-mspace</dt><dd>

Try to make the code as small as possible.  At present, this just turns
on the <span class="option">-mep</span> and <span class="option">-mprolog-function</span> options.
      </dd><dt>-mtda=<em><code>n</code></em></dt><dd>

Put static or global variables whose size is <em>n</em> bytes or less into

<p>The preprocessor constants <em>_ _v850</em> and <em>_ _v851_ _</em> are always
defined, regardless of which processor variant is the target.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mdisable-callt</dt>


      <dt>-mno-disable-callt</dt><dd>


This option suppresses generation of the <em>`CALLT'</em> instruction for the
v850e, v850e1, v850e2, v850e2v3 and v850e3v5 flavors of the v850
architecture.

<p>This option is enabled by default when the RH850 ABI is
in use (see <span class="option">-mrh850-abi</span>), and disabled by default when the
GCC ABI is in use.  If <em>`CALLT'</em> instructions are being generated
then the C preprocessor symbol <em>`_ _V850_CALLT_ _'</em> will be defined.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mrelax</dt>

Disable (or re-enable) the generation of PC-relative jump instructions.
      </dd><dt>-msoft-float</dt>


      <dt>-mhard-float</dt><dd>


Disable (or re-enable) the generation of hardware floating point

architecture is <em>V850E2V3</em> or higher.  If hardware floating point
instructions are being generated then the C preprocessor symbol
<em>`_ _FPU_OK_ _'</em> will be defined, otherwise the symbol
<em>`_ _NO_FPU_ _'</em> will be defined.
      </dd><dt>-mloop</dt><dd>

Enables the use of the e3v5 LOOP instruction.  The use of this
instruction is not enabled by default when the e3v5 architecture is
selected because its use is still experimental.
      </dd><dt>-mrh850-abi</dt>


      <dt>-mghs</dt><dd>


Enables support for the RH850 version of the V850 ABI.  This is the
default.  With this version of the ABI the following rules apply:
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle; "><li>
<p>Integer sized structures and unions are returned via a memory pointer
rather than a register.</p>
          </li><li>

          </li></ul>
      

<p>When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol
<em>`_ _V850_RH850_ABI_ _'</em> is defined.
        </p> 
      </dd><dt>-mgcc-abi</dt><dd>

<p>When this version of the ABI is enabled the C preprocessor symbol
<em>`_ _V850_GCC_ABI_ _'</em> is defined.
        </p> 
      </dd><dt>-m8byte-align</dt>


      <dt>-mno-8byte-align</dt><dd>


Enables support for <em>`doubles'</em> and <em>`long long'</em> types to be
aligned on 8-byte boundaries.  The default is to restrict the
alignment of all objects to at most 4-bytes.  When
<span class="option">-m8byte-align</span> is in effect the C preprocessor symbol
<em>`_ _V850_8BYTE_ALIGN_ _'</em> will be defined.
      </dd><dt>-mbig-switch</dt><dd>

Generate code suitable for big switch tables.  Use this option only if
the assembler/linker complain about out of range branches within a switch
table.
      </dd><dt>-mapp-regs</dt><dd>

This option causes r2 and r5 to be used in the code generated by
the compiler.  This setting is the default.
      </dd><dt>-mno-app-regs</dt><dd>

This option causes r2 and r5 to be treated as fixed registers.

<p><em>VAX Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for the VAX:</p>
      </dd><dt>-munix</dt><dd>

Do not output certain jump instructions (<em>`aobleq'</em> and so on)
that the Unix assembler for the VAX cannot handle across long
ranges.
      </dd><dt>-mgnu</dt><dd>

Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that the
GNU assembler is being used.
      </dd><dt>-mg</dt><dd>

Output code for G-format floating-point numbers instead of D-format.

<p><em>VMS Options</em>
</p>

<p>These <span class="option">-m</span> options are defined for the VMS implementations:</p>
      </dd><dt>-mvms-return-codes</dt><dd>

Return VMS condition codes from <em>`main'</em>. The default is to return POSIX-style
condition (e.g. error) codes.
      </dd><dt>-mdebug-main=<em><code>prefix</code></em></dt><dd>

Flag the first routine whose name starts with <em>prefix</em> as the main
routine for the debugger.
      </dd><dt>-mmalloc64</dt><dd>

Default to 64-bit memory allocation routines.
      </dd><dt>-mpointer-size=<em><code>size</code></em></dt><dd>

Set the default size of pointers. Possible options for <em>size</em> are
<code class="literal">32</code> or <em>short</em> for 32 bit pointers, <code class="literal">64</code> or <em>long</em>
for 64 bit pointers, and <em>no</em> for supporting only 32 bit pointers.
The later option disables <em>`pragma pointer_size'</em>.

<p><em>VxWorks Options</em>
</p>

<p>The options in this section are defined for all VxWorks targets.
Options specific to the target hardware are listed with the other
options for that target.</p>
      </dd><dt>-mrtp</dt><dd>

GCC can generate code for both VxWorks kernels and real time processes
(RTPs).  This option switches from the former to the latter.  It also
defines the preprocessor macro <em>`_ _RTP_ _'</em>.
      </dd><dt>-non-static</dt><dd>

Link an RTP executable against shared libraries rather than static
libraries.  The options <span class="option">-static</span> and <span class="option">-shared</span> can
also be used for RTPs; <span class="option">-static</span>
is the default.
      </dd><dt>-Bstatic</dt>


      <dt>-Bdynamic</dt><dd>


These options are passed down to the linker.  They are defined for
compatibility with Diab.
      </dd><dt>-Xbind-lazy</dt><dd>

Enable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is equivalent to
<span class="option">-Wl,-z,now</span> and is defined for compatibility with Diab.
      </dd><dt>-Xbind-now</dt><dd>

Disable lazy binding of function calls.  This option is the default and
is defined for compatibility with Diab.

<p><em>x86-64 Options</em>
</p>

<p>These are listed under</p>

<p><em>Xstormy16 Options</em>
</p>

<p>These options are defined for Xstormy16:</p>
      </dd><dt>-msim</dt><dd>

Choose startup files and linker script suitable for the simulator.

<p><em>Xtensa Options</em>
</p>

<p>These options are supported for Xtensa targets:</p>
      </dd><dt>-mconst16</dt>


      <dt>-mno-const16</dt><dd>


Enable or disable use of <em>`CONST16'</em> instructions for loading
constant values.  The <em>`CONST16'</em> instruction is currently not a
standard option from Tensilica.  When enabled, <em>`CONST16'</em>
instructions are always used in place of the standard <em>`L32R'</em>
instructions.  The use of <em>`CONST16'</em> is enabled by default only if
the <em>`L32R'</em> instruction is not available.
      </dd><dt>-mfused-madd</dt>


      <dt>-mno-fused-madd</dt><dd>


Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict IEEE 754-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with <em>more</em> bits of
precision than specified by the IEEE standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.
      </dd><dt>-mserialize-volatile</dt>


      <dt>-mno-serialize-volatile</dt><dd>


When this option is enabled, GCC inserts <em>`MEMW'</em> instructions before
<em>`volatile'</em> memory references to guarantee sequential consistency.
The default is <span class="option">-mserialize-volatile</span>.  Use
<span class="option">-mno-serialize-volatile</span> to omit the <em>`MEMW'</em> instructions.
      </dd><dt>-mforce-no-pic</dt><dd>

For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must be
position-independent code (PIC), this option disables PIC for compiling
kernel code.
      </dd><dt>-mtext-section-literals</dt>


      <dt>-mno-text-section-literals</dt><dd>


Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
<span class="option">-mno-text-section-literals</span>, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed
in a data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With <span class="option">-mtext-section-literals</span>, the literals
are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly
files.
      </dd><dt>-mtarget-align</dt>


      <dt>-mno-target-align</dt><dd>


When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening is performed.  The
default is <span class="option">-mtarget-align</span>.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like <em>`LOOP'</em>, which the
assembler always aligns, either by widening density instructions or
by inserting NOP instructions.
      </dd><dt>-mlongcalls</dt>


      <dt>-mno-longcalls</dt><dd>


When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct <em>`CALL'</em>
instruction into an <em>`L32R'</em> followed by a <em>`CALLX'</em> instruction.
The default is <span class="option">-mno-longcalls</span>.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by GCC still shows direct call
instructions---look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.

<div class="subsection" id="Options-Options_for_Code_Generation_Conventions"><a href="#Options-Options_for_Code_Generation_Conventions"><h3>Options for Code Generation Conventions</h3></a>
<p>
These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.</p>

<p>Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of <span class="option">-ffoo</span> is <span class="option">-fno-foo</span>.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed---the one that is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing <em>no-</em> or adding
it.</p>
<dl><dt><a id="-fbounds-check" class="in-doc" href="#-fbounds-check">-fbounds-check</a></dt><dd>

For front ends that support it, generate additional code to check that
indices used to access arrays are within the declared range.  This is
currently only supported by the Java and Fortran front ends, where
this option defaults to true and false respectively.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fstack-reuse" class="in-doc" href="#-fstack-reuse">-fstack-reuse</a>=<em><code>reuse-level</code></em></dt><dd>

This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  <em>reuse_level</em> can be <em>all</em>,
<em>named_vars</em>, or <em>none</em>. <em>all</em> enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, <em>named_vars</em> enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and <em>none</em> disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is <em>all</em>. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime will likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>   int *p;
   {
     int local1;

     p = &amp;local1;
     local1 = 10;
     ....
   }
   {
      int local2;
      local2 = 20;
      ...
   }

   if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
     {

     }</code></pre> 

<p>Another example:</p>

<pre><code>   struct A
   {
       A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }
       int i;
       int j;
   };

   A *ap;

   void foo(const A&amp; ar)
   {
      ap = &amp;ar;
   }

   void bar()
   {
      foo(A(10)); // temp objects lifetime ends when foo returns

      {
        A a(20);
        ....
      }
      ap-&gt;i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
                   // is reused with a. What is the value of ap-&gt;i?
   }</code></pre> 

<p>The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the C++;
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries' stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-ftrapv" class="in-doc" href="#-ftrapv">-ftrapv</a></dt><dd>

This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fwrapv" class="in-doc" href="#-fwrapv">-fwrapv</a></dt><dd>

This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.  This option is enabled by default for the Java
front end, as required by the Java language specification.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fexceptions" class="in-doc" href="#-fexceptions">-fexceptions</a></dt><dd>

Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies GCC generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, GCC enables it by default for languages like
C++; that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in C++;.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older C++; programs that don't
use exception handling.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fnon-call-exceptions" class="in-doc" href="#-fnon-call-exceptions">-fnon-call-exceptions</a></dt><dd>

Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows <em>trapping</em>
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as <em>`SIGALRM'</em>.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fdelete-dead-exceptions" class="in-doc" href="#-fdelete-dead-exceptions">-fdelete-dead-exceptions</a></dt><dd>

Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise
contribute to the execution of the program can be optimized away.
This option is enabled by default for the Ada front end, as permitted by
the Ada language specification.
Optimization passes that cause dead exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
  </dd><dt><a id="-funwind-tables" class="in-doc" href="#-funwind-tables">-funwind-tables</a></dt><dd>

Similar to <span class="option">-fexceptions</span>, except that it just generates any needed
static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other way.
You normally do not need to enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fasynchronous-unwind-tables" class="in-doc" href="#-fasynchronous-unwind-tables">-fasynchronous-unwind-tables</a></dt><dd>

Generate unwind table in DWARF 2 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
  </dd><dt><a id="-fpcc-struct-return" class="in-doc" href="#-fpcc-struct-return">-fpcc-struct-return</a></dt><dd>

Return “short” <em>`struct'</em> and <em>`union'</em> values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).

<p>The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.</p>

<p>Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> code compiled with the <span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span> switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-freg-struct-return" class="in-doc" href="#-freg-struct-return">-freg-struct-return</a></dt><dd>

Return <em>`struct'</em> and <em>`union'</em> values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
<span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span>.

<p>If you specify neither <span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span> nor
<span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span>, GCC defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, GCC
defaults to <span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span>, except on targets where GCC is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.</p>

<p><em>Warning:</em> code compiled with the <span class="option">-freg-struct-return</span>
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
<span class="option">-fpcc-struct-return</span> switch.

  </dd><dt><a id="-fshort-enums" class="in-doc" href="#-fshort-enums">-fshort-enums</a></dt><dd>

Allocate to an <em>`enum'</em> type only as many bytes as it needs for the
declared range of possible values.  Specifically, the <em>`enum'</em> type
is equivalent to the smallest integer type that has enough room.

<p><em>Warning:</em> the <span class="option">-fshort-enums</span> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fshort-double" class="in-doc" href="#-fshort-double">-fshort-double</a></dt><dd>

Use the same size for <em>`double'</em> as for <em>`float'</em>.

<p><em>Warning:</em> the <span class="option">-fshort-double</span> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fshort-wchar" class="in-doc" href="#-fshort-wchar">-fshort-wchar</a></dt><dd>

Override the underlying type for <span class="type">wchar_t</span> to be <em>short
unsigned int</em> instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under WINE.

<p><em>Warning:</em> the <span class="option">-fshort-wchar</span> switch causes GCC to generate
code that is not binary compatible with code generated without that switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-common" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-common">-fno-common</a></dt><dd>

In C code, controls the placement of uninitialized global variables.
Unix C compilers have traditionally permitted multiple definitions of
such variables in different compilation units by placing the variables
in a common block.
This is the behavior specified by <span class="option">-fcommon</span>, and is the default
for GCC on most targets.
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by ISO C, and on some
targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on variable references.
The <span class="option">-fno-common</span> option specifies that the compiler should place
uninitialized global variables in the data section of the object file,
rather than generating them as common blocks.
This has the effect that if the same variable is declared
(without <em>`extern'</em>) in two different compilations,
you get a multiple-definition error when you link them.
In this case, you must compile with <span class="option">-fcommon</span> instead.
Compiling with <span class="option">-fno-common</span> is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable declarations this way.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-ident" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-ident">-fno-ident</a></dt><dd>

Ignore the <em>#ident</em> directive.
  </dd><dt><a id="-finhibit-size-directive" class="in-doc" href="#-finhibit-size-directive">-finhibit-size-directive</a></dt><dd>

Don't output a <em>`.size'</em> assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling <em>crtstuff.c</em>; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fverbose-asm" class="in-doc" href="#-fverbose-asm">-fverbose-asm</a></dt><dd>

Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).

<p><span class="option">-fno-verbose-asm</span>, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler
files.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-frecord-gcc-switches" class="in-doc" href="#-frecord-gcc-switches">-frecord-gcc-switches</a></dt><dd>

This switch causes the command line used to invoke the
compiler to be recorded into the object file that is being created.
This switch is only implemented on some targets and the exact format
of the recording is target and binary file format dependent, but it
usually takes the form of a section containing ASCII text.  This
switch is related to the <span class="option">-fverbose-asm</span> switch, but that
switch only records information in the assembler output file as
comments, so it never reaches the object file.
See also <span class="option">-grecord-gcc-switches</span> for another
way of storing compiler options into the object file.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fpic" class="in-doc" href="#-fpic">-fpic</a></dt><dd>

Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
library, if supported for the target machine.  Such code accesses all
constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT).  The dynamic
loader resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic
loader is not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system).  If
the GOT size for the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific
maximum size, you get an error message from the linker indicating that
<span class="option">-fpic</span> does not work; in that case, recompile with <span class="option">-fPIC</span>
instead.  (These maximums are 8k on the SPARC and 32k
on the m68k and RS/6000.  The 386 has no such limit.)

<p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.  For the 386, GCC supports PIC for System V
but not for the Sun 386i.  Code generated for the IBM RS/6000 is always
position-independent.</p>

<p>When this flag is set, the macros <em>`_ _pic_ _'</em> and <em>`_ _PIC_ _'</em>
are defined to 1.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fPIC" class="in-doc" href="#-fPIC">-fPIC</a></dt><dd>

If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code,
suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k,
PowerPC and SPARC.

<p>Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works
only on certain machines.</p>

<p>When this flag is set, the macros <em>`_ _pic_ _'</em> and <em>`_ _PIC_ _'</em>

  </dd><dt><a id="-fpie" class="in-doc" href="#-fpie">-fpie</a></dt>


  <dt><a id="-fPIE" class="in-doc" href="#-fPIE">-fPIE</a></dt><dd>


These options are similar to <span class="option">-fpic</span> and <span class="option">-fPIC</span>, but
generated position independent code can be only linked into executables.
Usually these options are used when <span class="option">-pie</span> GCC option is
used during linking.

<p><span class="option">-fpie</span> and <span class="option">-fPIE</span> both define the macros
<em>`_ _pie_ _'</em> and <em>`_ _PIE_ _'</em>.  The macros have the value 1
for <span class="option">-fpie</span> and 2 for <span class="option">-fPIE</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fno-jump-tables" class="in-doc" href="#-fno-jump-tables">-fno-jump-tables</a></dt><dd>

Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with <span class="option">-fpic</span> or <span class="option">-fPIC</span> for
building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a GOT and this option is not needed.
  </dd><dt><a id="-ffixed-" class="in-doc" href="#-ffixed-">-ffixed-</a><em><code>reg</code></em></dt><dd>

Treat the register named <em>reg</em> as a fixed register; generated code
should never refer to it (except perhaps as a stack pointer, frame
pointer or in some other fixed role).

<p><em>reg</em> must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the <em>`REGISTER_NAMES'</em>
macro in the machine description macro file.</p>

<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fcall-used-" class="in-doc" href="#-fcall-used-">-fcall-used-</a><em><code>reg</code></em></dt><dd>

Treat the register named <em>reg</em> as an allocable register that is
clobbered by function calls.  It may be allocated for temporaries or
variables that do not live across a call.  Functions compiled this way
do not save and restore the register <em>reg</em>.

<p>It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.</p>

<p>This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a

  </dd><dt><a id="-fcall-saved-" class="in-doc" href="#-fcall-saved-">-fcall-saved-</a><em><code>reg</code></em></dt><dd>

Treat the register named <em>reg</em> as an allocable register saved by

the register <em>reg</em> if they use it.

<p>It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.

Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this are output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.

<p><em>Warning:</em> the <span class="option">-fpack-struct</span> switch causes GCC to generate

Additionally, it makes the code suboptimal.

  </dd><dt><a id="-finstrument-functions" class="in-doc" href="#-finstrument-functions">-finstrument-functions</a></dt><dd>

Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions.  Just
after function entry and just before function exit, the following
profiling functions are called with the address of the current
function and its call site.  (On some platforms,
<em>`_ _builtin_return_address'</em> does not work beyond the current
function, so the call site information may not be available to the
profiling functions otherwise.)

<pre><code>void <span class="func-name">__cyg_profile_func_enter</span>(void * <var>this_fn</var>, void * <var>call_site</var>);<br><br>void <span class="func-name">__cyg_profile_func_exit</span>(void * <var>this_fn</var>, void * <var>call_site</var>);<br><br></code></pre> 
<p>The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.</p>

<p>This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use <em>extern inline</em> in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)</p>

<p>A function may be given the attribute <em>`no_instrument_function'</em>, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list" class="in-doc" href="#-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list">-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</a>=<em><code>file</code></em><em>,</em><em>file</em><em>,...</em></dt><dd>

Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see
the description of <em>`-finstrument-functions'</em>).  If the file that
contains a function definition matches with one of <em>file</em>, then
that function is not instrumented.  The match is done on substrings:
if the <em>file</em> parameter is a substring of the file name, it is
considered to be a match.

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys</code></pre> 

<p>excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
contain <em>`/bits/stl'</em> or <em>`include/sys'</em>.</p>

<p>If, for some reason, you want to include letter <em>,</em> in one of
<em>sym</em>, write <em>,</em>. For example,
<em>`-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=,,tmp'</em>
(note the single quote surrounding the option).</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list" class="in-doc" href="#-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list">-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list</a>=<em><code>sym</code></em><em>,</em><em>sym</em><em>,...</em></dt><dd>

This is similar to <em>`-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list'</em>,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as <em>`vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)'</em>, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., <em>`_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE'</em>).  The
match is done on substrings: if the <em>sym</em> parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and C++;
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in UTF-8, not
using universal character names.
  </dd><dt><a id="-fstack-check" class="in-doc" href="#-fstack-check">-fstack-check</a></dt><dd>

Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.

<p>Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.</p>

<p>You can additionally specify a string parameter: <em>`no'</em> means no
checking, <em>`generic'</em> means force the use of old-style checking,
<em>`specific'</em> means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare <span class="option">-fstack-check</span>.</p>

<p>Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:</p>
    <dl class="same-line"><dt>1.</dt><dd>
Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.
      </dd><dt>2.</dt><dd>
Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.
      </dd><dt>3.</dt><dd>
Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, code performance is hampered.
      </dd></dl>
  

<p>Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
<em>`specific'</em> if no target support has been added in the compiler.

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If a larger
stack is required, a signal is raised at run time.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.

<p>For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address <em>0x80000000</em>
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
<span class="option">-fstack-limit-symbol=_ _stack_limit</span> and
<span class="option">-Wl,--defsym,_ _stack_limit=0x7ffe0000</span> to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the GNU linker.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fsplit-stack" class="in-doc" href="#-fsplit-stack">-fsplit-stack</a></dt><dd>

Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.  This
is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer
necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the i386 and x86_64 back ends running
GNU/Linux.

<p>When code compiled with <span class="option">-fsplit-stack</span> calls code compiled
without <span class="option">-fsplit-stack</span>, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with <span class="option">-fsplit-stack</span> is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without <span class="option">-fsplit-stack</span> always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in GNU binutils release 2.21
and later.</p>

Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option---all
symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is <em>strongly</em> recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.

<p>Despite the nomenclature, <em>`default'</em> always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
<em>`protected'</em> and <em>`internal'</em> are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option is <em>`hidden'</em>.
The default if <span class="option">-fvisibility</span> isn't specified is
<em>`default'</em>, i.e., make every
symbol public---this causes the same behavior as previous versions of
GCC.</p>

<p>A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF
symbols have the correct visibility is given by “How To Write
Shared Libraries” by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
&lt;<em><a href="http://people.redhat.com/%7Edrepper/">people.redhat.com/~drepper/</a></em>&gt;)---however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with <span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span>
and <em>`_ _attribute_ _ ((visibility("default")))'</em> instead of
<em>`_ _declspec(dllexport)'</em> you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.</p>

<p>For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
<em>#pragma GCC visibility</em> of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
<em>#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)</em> and
<em>#pragma GCC visibility pop</em>.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed <em>as
part of the API interface contract</em> and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local DSO should <em>always</em> be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid PLT indirection overheads---making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to ISO C++; specification requirements, <em>`operator new'</em> and
<em>`operator delete'</em> must always be of default visibility.</p>

<p>Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say <em>#pragma GCC visibility push(default)</em>
before including any such headers.</p>

<p><em>extern</em> declarations are not affected by <span class="option">-fvisibility</span>, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with <span class="option">-fvisibility=hidden</span> with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to <em>`extern'</em>
functions with no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is more
effective to use <em>`_ _attribute ((visibility))'</em> and/or
<em>`#pragma GCC visibility'</em> to tell the compiler which <em>`extern'</em>
declarations should be treated as hidden.</p>

<p>Note that <span class="option">-fvisibility</span> does affect C++; vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the <em>type_info</em> nodes are unified between
the DSOs.</p>

<p>An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at &lt;<em><a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility">gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</a></em>&gt;.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fstrict-volatile-bitfields" class="in-doc" href="#-fstrict-volatile-bitfields">-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</a></dt><dd>

This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as <em>`unsigned short'</em> (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.

<p>If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.</p>

<p>If the target requires strict alignment, and honoring the field
type would require violating this alignment, a warning is issued.
If the field has <em>`packed'</em> attribute, the access is done without
honoring the field type.  If the field doesn't have <em>`packed'</em>
attribute, the access is done honoring the field type.  In both cases,
GCC assumes that the user knows something about the target hardware
that it is unaware of.</p>

<p>The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.</p>
  </dd><dt><a id="-fsync-libcalls" class="in-doc" href="#-fsync-libcalls">-fsync-libcalls</a></dt><dd>

This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the <em>`_ _sync'</em>
family of functions may be used to implement the C++;11 <em>`_ _atomic'</em>
family of functions.

<p>The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is <span class="option">-fno-sync-libcalls</span>.  This option is used in
the implementation of the <em>libatomic</em> runtime library.</p>

<div class="section" id="Environment"><a href="#Environment"><h2>Environment</h2></a>
<p>
This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.</p>

<p>Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
<span class="option">-B</span>, <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span> and <span class="option">-L</span>.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of GCC.</p>
<dl><dt id="LANG"><em>LANG</em></dt>


  <dt id="LC_CTYPE"><em>LC_CTYPE</em></dt>

  <dt id="LC_MESSAGES"><em>LC_MESSAGES</em></dt>

  <dt id="LC_ALL"><em>LC_ALL</em></dt><dd>


These environment variables control the way that GCC uses
localization information which allows GCC to work with different
national conventions.  GCC inspects the locale categories
<em>LC_CTYPE</em> and <em>LC_MESSAGES</em> if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is <em>en_GB.UTF-8</em> for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.

<p>The <em>LC_CTYPE</em> environment variable specifies character
classification.  GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string
end or escape.</p>

<p>The <em>LC_MESSAGES</em> environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.</p>

<p>If the <em>LC_ALL</em> environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of <em>LC_CTYPE</em> and <em>LC_MESSAGES</em>; otherwise, <em>LC_CTYPE</em>
and <em>LC_MESSAGES</em> default to the value of the <em>LANG</em>
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, GCC
defaults to traditional C English behavior.</p>
  </dd><dt id="TMPDIR"><em>TMPDIR</em></dt><dd>

If <em>TMPDIR</em> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
  </dd><dt id="GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG"><em>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</em></dt><dd>

Setting <em>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</em> is nearly equivalent to passing
<span class="option">-fcompare-debug</span> to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.
  </dd><dt id="GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"><em>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</em></dt><dd>

If <em>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</em> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.

<p>If <em>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</em> is not set, GCC attempts to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.</p>

<p>If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.</p>

<p>The default value of <em>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</em> is
<em>prefix/lib/gcc/</em> where <em>prefix</em> is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases <em>prefix</em> is the value
of <em>`prefix'</em> when you ran the <em>configure</em> script.</p>

<p>Other prefixes specified with <span class="option">-B</span> take precedence over this prefix.</p>

<p>This prefix is also used for finding files such as <em>crt0.o</em> that are
used for linking.</p>

<p>In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with <code class="filename">/usr/local/lib/gcc</code>
(more precisely, with the value of <em>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</em>), GCC tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with <span class="option">-Bfoo/</span>, GCC searches
<em>foo/bar</em> just before it searches the standard directory 
<code class="filename">/usr/local/lib/bar</code>.
If a standard directory begins with the configured
<em>prefix</em> then the value of <em>prefix</em> is replaced by
<em>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</em> when looking for header files.</p>
  </dd><dt id="COMPILER_PATH"><em>COMPILER_PATH</em></dt><dd>

The value of <em>COMPILER_PATH</em> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <em>PATH</em>.  GCC tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it can't find the
subprograms using <em>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</em>.
  </dd><dt id="LIBRARY_PATH"><em>LIBRARY_PATH</em></dt><dd>

The value of <em>LIBRARY_PATH</em> is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like <em>PATH</em>.  When configured as a native compiler,
GCC tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it can't find them using <em>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</em>.  Linking
using GCC also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-l">-l</a></span> option (but directories specified with
<span class="option">-L</span> come first).
  </dd><dt><em>LANG</em></dt><dd>

This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and C++;.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for <em>LANG</em> are recognized:
    <dl><dt><em>C-JIS</em></dt><dd>

Recognize JIS characters.
      </dd><dt><em>C-SJIS</em></dt><dd>

Recognize SJIS characters.
      </dd><dt><em>C-EUCJP</em></dt><dd>

Recognize EUCJP characters.
      </dd></dl>
  

<p>If <em>LANG</em> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses <em>`mblen'</em> and <em>`mbtowc'</em> as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
    </p> 

<p>Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.</p>
  </dd><dt id="CPATH"><em>CPATH</em></dt>


  <dt id="C_INCLUDE_PATH"><em>C_INCLUDE_PATH</em></dt>

  <dt id="CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"><em>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</em></dt>

  <dt id="OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH"><em>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</em></dt><dd>


Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like <em>PATH</em>, in which to look for header files.
The special character, <em>`PATH_SEPARATOR'</em>, is target-dependent and
determined at GCC build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.

<p><em>CPATH</em> specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span>, but after any paths given with <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a></span>
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.</p>

<p>The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with <span class="option">-isystem</span>, but after any
paths given with <span class="option">-isystem</span> options on the command line.</p>

<p>In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
<em>CPATH</em> is <em>`:/special/include'</em>, that has the same
effect as <span class="option"><a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a>.&nbsp;<a class="in-doc" href="#-I">-I</a>/special/include</span>.</p>
  </dd><dt id="DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"><em>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</em></dt><dd>

If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.

<p>The value of <em>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</em> can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
<em>file</em><em>target</em>, in which case the rules are written to
file <code class="filename">file</code> using <em>target</em> as the target name.</p>

<p>In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options <span class="option">-MM</span> and <span class="option">-MF</span>,
with an optional <span class="option">-MT</span> switch too.</p>
  </dd><dt id="SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"><em>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</em></dt><dd>

This variable is the same as <em>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</em> (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
<span class="option">-M</span> rather than <span class="option">-MM</span>.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.

On some systems, <code>gcc -shared</code>
needs to build supplementary stub code for constructors to work.  On
multi-libbed systems, <code>gcc -shared</code> must select the correct support
libraries to link against.  Failing to supply the correct flags may lead
to subtle defects.  Supplying them in cases where they are not necessary
