# About
the file MountingHole_RevA.mod.

Contains the KiCAD module/footprint of some
mounting holes.

Normaly mounting holes in KiCAD are made by setting a 
pad, and setting the hole diameter and pad diameter 
to the same size. So there will be no pad. This is, 
because you often do not want pads at mounting holes. 
But sometimes, you want a broader marking of the hole
somewhere, but not in the gerber files. For this purpose, 
this mounting holes are created, with the pad not at the 
copper layer, but at the comment layer. So you do not 
have it at the gerber files (I suppose, you do not export 
your comment layer to gerber), but you can see and print 
it. But be careful, because i violated some rules doing this.
KiCAD normally does not accept any non copper layer as
pad, and so, using this layers is blocked. I did this by
editing the .mod-file with an editor, but if you now try
to edit this holes, you cannot do this, because at
every change KiCAD will recognises the non copper layer
and blocks the editing of the pad. At moment,
KiCAD  (2011-04-29 BZR 2986)-stable works fine with this
workaround, but this may not work at the future. You are
recommended to use non-copper-plated holes, if you use
holes without pads. Also, i may be more useful, to use
milled holes for greater diameters.
There exists also a symbol "Mounting hole". So you can put
this holes on the schematic, and link it to a mounting hole
footprint for PCBnew in CVpcb. This has the advantage,
that you will allways keep the holes and not vorget them by
re-reading the netlist at PCBnew.
